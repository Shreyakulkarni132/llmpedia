{"Published": "2023-07-09", "Title": "Using Large Language Models to Simulate Multiple Humans and Replicate Human Subject Studies", "Authors": "Gati Aher, Rosa I. Arriaga, Adam Tauman Kalai", "Summary": "We introduce a new type of test, called a Turing Experiment (TE), for evaluating to what extent a given language model, such as GPT models, can simulate different aspects of human behavior. A TE can also reveal consistent distortions in a language model's simulation of a specific human behavior. Unlike the Turing Test, which involves simulating a single arbitrary individual, a TE requires simulating a representative sample of participants in human subject research. We carry out TEs that attempt to replicate well-established findings from prior studies. We design a methodology for simulating TEs and illustrate its use to compare how well different language models are able to reproduce classic economic, psycholinguistic, and social psychology experiments: Ultimatum Game, Garden Path Sentences, Milgram Shock Experiment, and Wisdom of Crowds. In the first three TEs, the existing findings were replicated using recent models, while the last TE reveals a \"hyper-accuracy distortion\" present in some language models (including ChatGPT and GPT-4), which could affect downstream applications in education and the arts.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Introduction of Turing Experiments for Evaluating Language Models' Ability to Simulate Human Behavior", "description": "The paper introduces a new type of test, the Turing Experiment (TE), designed to evaluate how well a given language model can simulate different aspects of human behavior.

By simulating a representative sample of participants in human subject research, TEs can reveal both the strengths and weaknesses of a model's ability to simulate human behavior. This can inform downstream applications that require accurate models of humans, including applications in education and the arts. Practitioners can use TEs to identify and correct distortions in their models, such as the 'hyper-accuracy distortion' identified in this paper.", "example": "For instance, an LLM practitioner could use a TE to evaluate how well their model simulates the behavior of participants in the Ultimatum Game. If the model's behavior does not align with established findings, the practitioner could adjust the model or its training data to improve its performance."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper introduces a novel concept, the Turing Experiment, which extends the traditional Turing Test to evaluate a language model's ability to simulate a representative sample of human behavior.
