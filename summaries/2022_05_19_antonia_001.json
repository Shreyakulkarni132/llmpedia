{"Published": "2022-05-19", "Title": "Selection-Inference: Exploiting Large Language Models for Interpretable Logical Reasoning", "Authors": "Antonia Creswell, Murray Shanahan, Irina Higgins", "Summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be capable of impressive few-shot generalisation to new tasks. However, they still tend to perform poorly on multi-step logical reasoning problems. Here we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs on 50 tasks that probe different aspects of logical reasoning. We show that language models tend to perform fairly well at single step inference or entailment tasks, but struggle to chain together multiple reasoning steps to solve more complex problems. In light of this, we propose a Selection-Inference (SI) framework that exploits pre-trained LLMs as general processing modules, and alternates between selection and inference to generate a series of interpretable, casual reasoning steps leading to the final answer. We show that a 7B parameter LLM used within the SI framework in a 5-shot generalisation setting, with no fine-tuning, yields a performance improvement of over 100% compared to an equivalent vanilla baseline on a suite of 10 logical reasoning tasks. The same model in the same setting even outperforms a significantly larger 280B parameter baseline on the same suite of tasks. Moreover, answers produced by the SI framework are accompanied by a causal natural-language-based reasoning trace, which has important implications for the safety and trustworthiness of the system.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Selection-Inference (SI) framework enhances LLMs' logical reasoning capabilities", "description": "The paper introduces the Selection-Inference (SI) framework, a novel approach to improve the logical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The SI framework leverages pre-trained LLMs as general processing modules, alternating between selection and inference to generate a series of interpretable, causal reasoning steps leading to the final answer. The authors demonstrate that a 7B parameter LLM, when used within the SI framework without any fine-tuning, significantly outperforms both an equivalent vanilla baseline and a significantly larger 280B parameter baseline on a suite of 10 logical reasoning tasks. Importantly, the SI framework also provides a natural-language-based reasoning trace, enhancing the system's interpretability, safety, and trustworthiness."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "SI framework offers a new approach to improve LLMs' logical reasoning", "description": "The SI framework presents a promising strategy for enhancing the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By alternating between selection and inference, it allows LLMs to generate a series of interpretable, causal reasoning steps, thereby solving complex problems more effectively. This approach not only improves performance on logical reasoning tasks but also provides a reasoning trace, which can enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM-based systems. However, the practicality of this framework in diverse fields or contexts might be limited due to its application-specific design.", "example": "For instance, an LLM using the SI framework, when tasked with a complex logical reasoning problem, would alternate between selection and inference steps to generate a series of reasoning steps leading to the final answer. Each step would be interpretable and provide a trace of the reasoning process, enhancing the system's transparency and trustworthiness."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of the SI framework represents a significant advancement in the field of LLMs, particularly in enhancing their logical reasoning capabilities.
