{"Published": "2023-05-25", "Title": "Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models", "Authors": "Guanzhi Wang, Yuqi Xie, Yunfan Jiang, Ajay Mandlekar, Chaowei Xiao, Yuke Zhu, Linxi Fan, Anima Anandkumar", "Summary": "We introduce Voyager, the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent in Minecraft that continuously explores the world, acquires diverse skills, and makes novel discoveries without human intervention. Voyager consists of three key components: 1) an automatic curriculum that maximizes exploration, 2) an ever-growing skill library of executable code for storing and retrieving complex behaviors, and 3) a new iterative prompting mechanism that incorporates environment feedback, execution errors, and self-verification for program improvement. Voyager interacts with GPT-4 via blackbox queries, which bypasses the need for model parameter fine-tuning. The skills developed by Voyager are temporally extended, interpretable, and compositional, which compounds the agent's abilities rapidly and alleviates catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, Voyager shows strong in-context lifelong learning capability and exhibits exceptional proficiency in playing Minecraft. It obtains 3.3x more unique items, travels 2.3x longer distances, and unlocks key tech tree milestones up to 15.3x faster than prior SOTA. Voyager is able to utilize the learned skill library in a new Minecraft world to solve novel tasks from scratch, while other techniques struggle to generalize. We open-source our full codebase and prompts at https://voyager.minedojo.org/.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Voyager: An LLM-Powered Lifelong Learning Agent for Minecraft", "description": "The paper introduces Voyager, a novel LLM-powered agent designed for lifelong learning in the open-ended environment of Minecraft.

Its automatic curriculum, skill library, and iterative prompting mechanism can be adapted to other LLM applications, potentially improving their ability to learn and adapt over time. Voyager's ability to interact with GPT-4 via blackbox queries also opens up possibilities for using LLMs without the need for model parameter fine-tuning. The skills developed by Voyager are not only temporally extended and interpretable, but also compositional, which can rapidly compound an agent's abilities and alleviate catastrophic forgetting.", "example": "Consider a scenario where an LLM is deployed in a dynamic and complex environment like a stock market simulation. The LLM can use Voyager's automatic curriculum to explore different investment strategies, its skill library to store and retrieve successful strategies, and its iterative prompting mechanism to refine strategies based on feedback from the simulation. This could lead to the LLM developing a diverse set of investment strategies that it can apply and adapt to different market conditions."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "Voyager represents a significant advancement in the field of LLMs, being the first LLM-powered agent designed for lifelong learning in an open-ended environment like Minecraft. Its unique combination of an automatic curriculum, a skill library of executable code, and an iterative prompting mechanism sets it apart from previous work in the field.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is highly technical, delving into the details of Voyager's three key components and how they interact with GPT-4. It also presents a detailed evaluation of Voyager's performance in Minecraft, comparing it with other LLM-based agent techniques. Understanding the paper fully requires a solid background in LLMs and reinforcement learning.", "technical_score": 3, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents a novel and intriguing contribution to the field of LLMs. The use of Minecraft as a test environment adds an element of fun and relatability to the paper. However, the high level of technical detail may make it a challenging read for those without a strong background in the field.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
