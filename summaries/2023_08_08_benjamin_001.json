{"Published": "2023-08-08", "Title": "Accelerating LLM Inference with Staged Speculative Decoding", "Authors": "Benjamin Spector, Chris Re", "Summary": "Recent advances with large language models (LLM) illustrate their diverse capabilities. We propose a novel algorithm, staged speculative decoding, to accelerate LLM inference in small-batch, on-device scenarios. We address the low arithmetic intensity of small-batch inference by improving upon previous work in speculative decoding. First, we restructure the speculative batch as a tree, which reduces generation costs and increases the expected tokens per batch. Second, we add a second stage of speculative decoding. Taken together, we reduce single-batch decoding latency by 3.16x with a 762M parameter GPT-2-L model while perfectly preserving output quality.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Staged Speculative Decoding Accelerates LLM Inference", "description": "The paper introduces a novel algorithm, staged speculative decoding, to accelerate inference in large language models (LLMs) for small-batch, on-device scenarios.

By restructuring the speculative batch as a tree and adding a second stage of speculative decoding, the algorithm reduces generation costs and increases the expected tokens per batch. This results in a significant reduction in single-batch decoding latency, making it particularly useful for applications that require low-latency responses or where data privacy is paramount. The algorithm can be applied to any LLM, offering a practical way to enhance performance in a wide range of applications.", "example": "For instance, in a chatbot application where latency and data privacy are crucial, the staged speculative decoding algorithm can be used to accelerate the inference of the LLM used by the chatbot, improving its responsiveness and preserving user data privacy."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "The staged speculative decoding algorithm represents a significant advancement in the field of LLM inference.
