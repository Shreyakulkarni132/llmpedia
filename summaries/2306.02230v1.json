{"Published": "2023-06-04", "Title": "Prompt Sapper: LLM-Empowered Software Engineering Infrastructure for AI-Native Services", "Authors": "Zhenchang Xing, Qing Huang, Yu Cheng, Liming Zhu, Qinghua Lu, Xiwei Xu", "Summary": "Foundation models, such as GPT-4, DALL-E have brought unprecedented AI \"operating system\" effect and new forms of human-AI interaction, sparking a wave of innovation in AI-native services, where natural language prompts serve as executable \"code\" directly (prompt as executable code), eliminating the need for programming language as an intermediary and opening up the door to personal AI. Prompt Sapper has emerged in response, committed to support the development of AI-native services by AI chain engineering. It creates a large language model (LLM) empowered software engineering infrastructure for authoring AI chains through human-AI collaborative intelligence, unleashing the AI innovation potential of every individual, and forging a future where everyone can be a master of AI innovation. This article will introduce the R\\&D motivation behind Prompt Sapper, along with its corresponding AI chain engineering methodology and technical practices.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Prompt Sapper: A Large Language Model Empowered Software Engineering Infrastructure", "description": "This paper introduces Prompt Sapper, a software engineering infrastructure that leverages large language models (LLMs) to support the development of AI-native services. The system is designed to facilitate AI chain engineering, a process that allows individuals to create, customize, and compose AI services using natural language prompts as executable code. This approach eliminates the need for traditional programming and AI training, focusing instead on describing 'what to do' rather than 'how to do'. The authors envision a future where everyone can be a master of AI innovation, thanks to the capabilities of Prompt Sapper."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Prompt Sapper Enables AI-Native Services Development Using Natural Language", "description": "Prompt Sapper offers a new way to create AI-native services using natural language prompts, which can be a game-changer for LLM practitioners. It allows for the development of AI services without the need for traditional programming or AI training. This could potentially simplify the process of creating AI applications and make it accessible to a wider range of individuals, including those without a technical background. The concept of AI chain engineering introduced in this paper could also inspire new workflows and methodologies in the field of AI development.", "example": "For instance, using Prompt Sapper, a user could create an AI service by simply describing the desired outcome in natural language. The system would then use an LLM to interpret the prompt and generate the corresponding AI service. This could significantly streamline the process of AI development and make it more accessible to non-technical users."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "Prompt Sapper represents a novel approach to AI development, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to interpret natural language prompts and generate AI services. This concept of AI chain engineering is a significant departure from traditional methods of AI development, marking a unique contribution to the field.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, discussing the concept of AI chain engineering and the design of the Prompt Sapper system.
