Self-Supervised Evaluation for Large Language Models", "Authors": "Neel Jain, Khalid Saifullah, Yuxin Wen, John Kirchenbauer, Manli Shu, Aniruddha Saha, Micah Goldblum, Jonas Geiping, Tom Goldstein", "Summary": "With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their ubiquitous deployment in diverse domains, measuring language model behavior on realistic data is imperative. For example, a company deploying a client-facing chatbot must ensure that the model will not respond to client requests with profanity. Current evaluations approach this problem using small, domain-specific datasets with human-curated labels. These evaluation sets are often sampled from a narrow and simplified distribution, and data sources can unknowingly be leaked into the training set which can lead to misleading evaluations. To bypass these drawbacks, we propose a framework for self-supervised evaluation of LLMs by analyzing their sensitivity or invariance to transformations on the input text. Self-supervised evaluation can directly monitor LLM behavior on datasets collected in the wild or streamed during live model deployment. We demonstrate self-supervised evaluation strategies for measuring closed-book knowledge, toxicity, and long-range context dependence, in addition to sensitivity to grammatical structure and tokenization errors. When comparisons to similar human-labeled benchmarks are available, we find strong correlations between self-supervised and human-supervised evaluations. The self-supervised paradigm complements current evaluation strategies that rely on labeled data.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Self-Supervised Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models", "description": "The paper introduces a self-supervised evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that bypasses the limitations of current evaluation methods that rely on small, domain-specific datasets with human-curated labels.

This approach can be particularly useful for companies deploying LLMs in diverse domains, as it allows them to ensure that the model behaves as expected on realistic data. For example, a company deploying a client-facing chatbot can use this framework to ensure that the model will not respond to client requests with profanity.", "example": "For instance, given a corpus D (e.g., Wikipedia), we construct pairs of original passages/sentences x, and transformed counterparts x'. An example is seen in Figure 1, where we negate the original sentence x to construct x'. X is the set of all transformed pairs. We then feed input pairs into the language model, f, to extract a pair of outputs. Depending on the construction, the output being considered can be the softmax probability vector over tokens, a perplexity score, or a feature vector. We then compare the outputs f(x) and f(x') using a similarity metric, M. Finally, we aggregate the results over all pairs in the data corpus using an aggregation operator, A, to produce an invariance/sensitivity score."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to evaluating LLMs by proposing a self-supervised evaluation framework.
