{"Published": "2023-05-26", "Title": "Towards Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Survey", "Authors": "Jie Huang, Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang", "Summary": "Reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence that plays a crucial role in activities such as problem solving, decision making, and critical thinking. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in natural language processing, and there is observation that these models may exhibit reasoning abilities when they are sufficiently large. However, it is not yet clear to what extent LLMs are capable of reasoning. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on reasoning in LLMs, including techniques for improving and eliciting reasoning in these models, methods and benchmarks for evaluating reasoning abilities, findings and implications of previous research in this field, and suggestions on future directions. Our aim is to provide a detailed and up-to-date review of this topic and stimulate meaningful discussion and future work.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Comprehensive survey on reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models", "description": "This paper provides an extensive overview of the current state of knowledge on reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). It discusses the techniques for improving and eliciting reasoning in these models, methods and benchmarks for evaluating reasoning abilities, and the findings and implications of previous research in this field. The authors also provide suggestions on future directions, aiming to stimulate meaningful discussion and future work. The paper does not introduce a new algorithm or technique but rather compiles and analyzes existing knowledge on the topic."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Insights into reasoning capabilities of LLMs can guide model development and application", "description": "The comprehensive survey of reasoning in LLMs presented in this paper can be a valuable resource for practitioners working with these models. Understanding the techniques for enhancing reasoning in LLMs can guide the development of more effective models. Knowledge of the methods and benchmarks for evaluating reasoning can help in assessing model performance. Insights into the findings and implications of previous research can inform the application of LLMs in various tasks.", "example": "For instance, a practitioner could use the techniques discussed in the paper to improve the reasoning abilities of an LLM used for a task like question answering. They could then use the evaluation methods and benchmarks presented to assess the model's performance."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper does not present new findings or contributions but rather compiles and analyzes existing knowledge on reasoning in LLMs. It provides a comprehensive overview of the topic, which can be valuable for practitioners and researchers in the field.", "novelty_score": 1, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical as it discusses various techniques, methods, and benchmarks related to reasoning in LLMs. However, it does not delve into complex mathematical theories or algorithms, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-organized and provides a comprehensive overview of a complex topic, making it an informative read.
