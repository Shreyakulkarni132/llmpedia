{"Published": "2023-07-26", "Title": "Educational data augmentation in physics education research using ChatGPT", "Authors": "Fabian Kieser, Peter Wulff, Jochen Kuhn, Stefan K\u00fcchemann", "Summary": "Generative AI technologies such as large language models show novel potentials to enhance educational research. For example, generative large language models were shown to be capable to solve quantitative reasoning tasks in physics and concept tests such as the Force Concept Inventory. Given the importance of such concept inventories for physics education research, and the challenges in developing them such as field testing with representative populations, this study seeks to examine to what extent a generative large language model could be utilized to generate a synthetic data set for the FCI that exhibits content-related variability in responses. We use the recently introduced ChatGPT based on the GPT 4 generative large language model and investigate to what extent ChatGPT could solve the FCI accurately (RQ1) and could be prompted to solve the FCI as-if it were a student belonging to a different cohort (RQ2). Furthermore, we study, to what extent ChatGPT could be prompted to solve the FCI as-if it were a student having a different force- and mechanics-related misconception (RQ3). In alignment with other research, we found the ChatGPT could accurately solve the FCI. We furthermore found that prompting ChatGPT to respond to the inventory as-if it belonged to a different cohort yielded no variance in responses, however, responding as-if it had a certain misconception introduced much variance in responses that approximate real human responses on the FCI in some regards.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "ChatGPT can generate synthetic data sets for physics education research", "description": "The paper explores the use of ChatGPT, a large language model, in generating synthetic data sets for physics education research.

They investigate whether ChatGPT can accurately solve the FCI, and if it can be prompted to solve the FCI as if it were a student from a different cohort or with a different misconception. The study found that while ChatGPT could accurately solve the FCI, prompting it to respond as if it belonged to a different cohort yielded no variance in responses.

This could be particularly useful in fields where gathering large amounts of real-world data is challenging or costly. The study also highlights the potential of using prompts to simulate different student misconceptions, which could be useful in developing and testing educational materials. However, the study also found that prompting ChatGPT to respond as if it belonged to a different cohort did not yield variance in responses, indicating that this approach may have limitations.", "example": "For instance, an LLM like ChatGPT could be used to generate synthetic responses to a physics concept test. By prompting the model to respond as if it had a certain misconception, researchers could generate a range of responses that approximate real student responses, aiding in the development and testing of educational materials."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel application of large language models in the field of educational research.
