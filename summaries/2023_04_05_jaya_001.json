{"Published": "2023-04-05", "Title": "Identifying Mentions of Pain in Mental Health Records Text: A Natural Language Processing Approach", "Authors": "Jaya Chaturvedi, Sumithra Velupillai, Robert Stewart, Angus Roberts", "Summary": "Pain is a common reason for accessing healthcare resources and is a growing area of research, especially in its overlap with mental health. Mental health electronic health records are a good data source to study this overlap. However, much information on pain is held in the free text of these records, where mentions of pain present a unique natural language processing problem due to its ambiguous nature. This project uses data from an anonymised mental health electronic health records database. The data are used to train a machine learning based classification algorithm to classify sentences as discussing patient pain or not. This will facilitate the extraction of relevant pain information from large databases, and the use of such outputs for further studies on pain and mental health. 1,985 documents were manually triple-annotated for creation of gold standard training data, which was used to train three commonly used classification algorithms. The best performing model achieved an F1-score of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98-0.99).", "main_contribution": "The paper presents a novel approach to identifying mentions of pain in mental health records using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The authors developed a machine learning-based classification algorithm that classifies sentences as discussing patient pain or not. They trained two BERT models (bert_base and SAPBERT) and compared them to two conventional models (SVM and KNN). This is the first attempt to extract information about pain from mental health clinical text using NLP.", "takeaways": "The developed algorithm can facilitate the extraction of relevant pain information from large databases, which can be used for further studies on pain and mental health. This approach can help overcome the challenge of ambiguous nature of pain mentions in free text of health records. The best performing model achieved an impressive F1-score of 0.98, indicating high precision and recall.", "novelty_analysis": "The novelty of this paper lies in its application of NLP and machine learning techniques to a unique problem: identifying mentions of pain in mental health records. While the use of NLP and machine learning in healthcare is not new, the specific application to pain identification in mental health records is a novel contribution.", "novelty_score": 2, "category": "USE CASES", "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, discussing the use of machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques. It requires a basic understanding of these concepts, but does not delve into the intricate details of the algorithms or the underlying mathematics.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents a novel and interesting application of NLP and machine learning. However, the technical nature of the content may make it less enjoyable for readers without a background in these areas.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
