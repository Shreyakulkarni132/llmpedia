{"Published": "2022-03-17", "Title": "AI Chains: Transparent and Controllable Human-AI Interaction by Chaining Large Language Model Prompts", "Authors": "Tongshuang Wu, Michael Terry, Carrie J. Cai", "Summary": "Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential on simple tasks, their breadth of scope, lack of transparency, and insufficient controllability can make them less effective when assisting humans on more complex tasks. In response, we introduce the concept of Chaining LLM steps together, where the output of one step becomes the input for the next, thus aggregating the gains per step. We first define a set of LLM primitive operations useful for Chain construction, then present an interactive system where users can modify these Chains, along with their intermediate results, in a modular way. In a 20-person user study, we found that Chaining not only improved the quality of task outcomes, but also significantly enhanced system transparency, controllability, and sense of collaboration. Additionally, we saw that users developed new ways of interacting with LLMs through Chains: they leveraged sub-tasks to calibrate model expectations, compared and contrasted alternative strategies by observing parallel downstream effects, and debugged unexpected model outputs by \"unit-testing\" sub-components of a Chain. In two case studies, we further explore how LLM Chains may be used in future applications", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Introduction of AI Chains for Enhanced Human-AI Interaction", "description": "The paper introduces the concept of AI Chains, a method of chaining Large Language Model (LLM) steps together to improve their effectiveness in complex tasks.

By chaining steps together, users can calibrate model expectations, compare strategies by observing downstream effects, and debug model outputs by testing sub-components of a Chain. This approach enhances system transparency and controllability, and fosters a sense of collaboration between the user and the AI. AI Chains could be used to build more effective and user-friendly AI systems.", "example": "For instance, in a task of summarizing a complex document, an AI Chain could be constructed where the first step is to identify key points, the second step is to generate a draft summary based on these points, and the third step is to refine the summary. Each step's output becomes the input for the next, and users can modify the Chain and its intermediate results as needed."}, "category": "PROMPTING", "novelty_analysis": "The concept of AI Chains is a novel approach to enhancing human-AI interaction and improving the performance of LLMs on complex tasks.
