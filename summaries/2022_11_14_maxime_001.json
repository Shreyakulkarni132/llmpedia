Yet, they suffer from spurious correlations, poor out-of-domain generalization, and biases. Inspired by recent progress in causal machine learning, in particular the invariant risk minimization (IRM) paradigm, we propose invariant language modeling, a framework for learning invariant representations that generalize better across multiple environments. In particular, we adapt a game-theoretic formulation of IRM (IRM-games) to language models, where the invariance emerges from a specific training schedule in which all the environments compete to optimize their own environment-specific loss by updating subsets of the model in a round-robin fashion. We focus on controlled experiments to precisely demonstrate the ability of our method to (i) remove structured noise, (ii) ignore specific spurious correlations without affecting global performance, and (iii) achieve better out-of-domain generalization. These benefits come with a negligible computational overhead compared to standard training, do not require changing the local loss, and can be applied to any language model. We believe this framework is promising to help mitigate spurious correlations and biases in language models.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Invariant Language Modeling: A Framework for Better Generalization Across Environments", "description": "The paper introduces Invariant Language Modeling (iLM), a novel framework that leverages the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) paradigm to improve the generalization of language models across different environments. The authors adapt a game-theoretic formulation of IRM, where invariance emerges from a specific training schedule. In this schedule, all environments compete to optimize their own environment-specific loss by updating subsets of the model in a round-robin fashion. The iLM framework is shown to effectively remove structured noise, ignore specific spurious correlations without affecting overall performance, and achieve better out-of-domain generalization. Importantly, these benefits are achieved with negligible computational overhead compared to standard training and can be applied to any language model."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "iLM Framework Enhances Generalization and Mitigates Biases in Language Models", "description": "The iLM framework presents a promising approach to mitigate spurious correlations and biases in language models, enhancing their generalization capabilities across different environments. This can be particularly useful in applications where models are expected to perform well across diverse data distributions. The framework does not require changing the local loss and can be applied to any language model, making it a versatile tool for LLM practitioners. The negligible computational overhead compared to standard training also makes it a practical choice for real-world applications.", "example": "For instance, an LLM practitioner can apply the iLM framework to a chatbot model to improve its performance across different user demographics and conversation contexts. The round-robin training schedule would allow the model to optimize for each specific environment (e.g., user demographic or conversation context), enhancing its overall generalization capability."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel application of the Invariant Risk Minimization paradigm to language models, introducing a new framework that enhances model generalization across different environments.
