Yet, they suffer from spurious correlations, poor out-of-domain generalization, and biases. Inspired by recent progress in causal machine learning, in particular the invariant risk minimization (IRM) paradigm, we propose invariant language modeling, a framework for learning invariant representations that generalize better across multiple environments. In particular, we adapt a game-theoretic formulation of IRM (IRM-games) to language models, where the invariance emerges from a specific training schedule in which all the environments compete to optimize their own environment-specific loss by updating subsets of the model in a round-robin fashion. We focus on controlled experiments to precisely demonstrate the ability of our method to (i) remove structured noise, (ii) ignore specific spurious correlations without affecting global performance, and (iii) achieve better out-of-domain generalization. These benefits come with a negligible computational overhead compared to standard training, do not require changing the local loss, and can be applied to any language model. We believe this framework is promising to help mitigate spurious correlations and biases in language models.", "main_contribution": "The paper introduces a new framework called Invariant Language Modeling (iLM), which is designed to improve the generalization of language models across multiple environments. The iLM framework is inspired by the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) paradigm from causal machine learning. The authors adapt a game-theoretic formulation of IRM to language models, where the invariance emerges from a specific training schedule. In this schedule, all the environments compete to optimize their own environment-specific loss by updating subsets of the model in a round-robin fashion.", "takeaways": "The iLM framework offers several advantages. It can remove structured noise, ignore specific spurious correlations without affecting global performance, and achieve better out-of-domain generalization. These benefits come with a negligible computational overhead compared to standard training, do not require changing the local loss, and can be applied to any language model. This makes the framework a promising tool to help mitigate spurious correlations and biases in language models.", "novelty_analysis": "The novelty of this paper lies in the introduction of the iLM framework, which is a new approach to improving the generalization of language models. The use of a game-theoretic formulation of IRM in language models is a unique contribution that sets this work apart from previous research.", "novelty_score": 3, "category": "TRAINING", "technical_analysis": "The paper is quite technical, as it introduces a new framework based on a game-theoretic formulation of IRM. Understanding the details of this framework would require a solid background in machine learning and language models.", "technical_score": 3, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents a novel and interesting contribution to the field of language models. However, the high level of technical detail may make it a challenging read for those without a strong background in the field.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
