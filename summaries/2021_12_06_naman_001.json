We view these developments with a mixture of optimism and caution. On the optimistic side, such large language models have the potential to improve productivity by providing an automated AI pair programmer for every programmer in the world. On the cautionary side, since these large language models do not understand program semantics, they offer no guarantees about quality of the suggested code. In this paper, we present an approach to augment these large language models with post-processing steps based on program analysis and synthesis techniques, that understand the syntax and semantics of programs. Further, we show that such techniques can make use of user feedback and improve with usage. We present our experiences from building and evaluating such a tool jigsaw, targeted at synthesizing code for using Python Pandas API using multi-modal inputs. Our experience suggests that as these large language models evolve for synthesizing code from intent, jigsaw has an important role to play in improving the accuracy of the systems.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Jigsaw: Augmenting Large Language Models with Post-Processing for Code Synthesis", "description": "This paper introduces Jigsaw, a tool that augments large language models (LLMs) with post-processing steps based on program analysis and synthesis techniques. These techniques understand the syntax and semantics of programs, addressing the limitation of LLMs that do not inherently understand program semantics. Jigsaw is designed to synthesize code for using Python Pandas API using multi-modal inputs, including a natural language string expressing intent and a set of test cases. The tool is designed to correct common and recurring errors made by LLMs, such as referencing errors, argument errors, and a class of semantic errors."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Jigsaw improves the accuracy of code synthesis by LLMs", "description": "Jigsaw presents a practical solution to improve the accuracy of code synthesis by LLMs. By understanding the syntax and semantics of programs, it can correct common errors made by LLMs, enhancing the quality of the generated code. This tool can be particularly useful for developers and AI practitioners who use LLMs for code generation, as it can significantly improve the productivity and efficiency of their work.", "example": "For instance, if an LLM generates a piece of code with referencing errors, Jigsaw can identify these errors and correct them based on its understanding of program semantics. This ensures that the final code is not only syntactically correct but also semantically meaningful."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to augment LLMs with post-processing steps based on program analysis and synthesis techniques. This approach addresses a significant limitation of LLMs, which is their lack of understanding of program semantics, making it a unique contribution to the field.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is quite technical as it delves into the details of program analysis and synthesis techniques, and how they are used to augment LLMs. It requires a good understanding of programming languages and LLMs to fully comprehend the content.", "technical_score": 3, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents a novel solution to a significant problem in the field of LLMs. However, the technical nature of the content might make it a challenging read for those without a strong background in the field.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
