{"Published": "2021-12-06", "Title": "Jigsaw: Large Language Models meet Program Synthesis", "Authors": "Naman Jain, Skanda Vaidyanath, Arun Iyer, Nagarajan Natarajan, Suresh Parthasarathy, Sriram Rajamani, Rahul Sharma", "Summary": "Large pre-trained language models such as GPT-3, Codex, and Google's language model are now capable of generating code from natural language specifications of programmer intent. We view these developments with a mixture of optimism and caution. On the optimistic side, such large language models have the potential to improve productivity by providing an automated AI pair programmer for every programmer in the world. On the cautionary side, since these large language models do not understand program semantics, they offer no guarantees about quality of the suggested code. In this paper, we present an approach to augment these large language models with post-processing steps based on program analysis and synthesis techniques, that understand the syntax and semantics of programs. Further, we show that such techniques can make use of user feedback and improve with usage. We present our experiences from building and evaluating such a tool jigsaw, targeted at synthesizing code for using Python Pandas API using multi-modal inputs. Our experience suggests that as these large language models evolve for synthesizing code from intent, jigsaw has an important role to play in improving the accuracy of the systems.", "main_contribution": "The paper introduces Jigsaw, a tool that augments large language models (LLMs) with post-processing steps based on program analysis and synthesis techniques. These techniques understand the syntax and semantics of programs, thereby improving the quality of code generated by LLMs. Jigsaw is designed to synthesize code for using Python Pandas API using multi-modal inputs, including natural language intent and a set of test cases.", "takeaways": "Jigsaw addresses the limitations of LLMs in generating code, particularly their lack of understanding of program semantics. By incorporating program analysis and synthesis techniques, Jigsaw can improve the accuracy of code generation, making it a valuable tool for developers. It also demonstrates the potential of LLMs to serve as automated AI pair programmers, enhancing productivity in the programming field.", "novelty_analysis": "While LLMs have been used for code generation before, the introduction of Jigsaw represents a novel approach to improving the quality of the generated code. The use of program analysis and synthesis techniques to understand syntax and semantics, and the incorporation of user feedback for continuous improvement, are unique features that distinguish Jigsaw from previous works.", "novelty_score": 3, "category": "USE CASES", "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, discussing the design and evaluation of Jigsaw, a multi-modal program synthesis system. It delves into the specifics of how Jigsaw uses program analysis and synthesis techniques to improve the quality of code generated by LLMs.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents a novel and practical solution to a real-world problem. The clear explanation of the problem and the proposed solution, along with the discussion of the potential benefits, make it an interesting read.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
