{"Published": "2023-05-09", "Title": "FrugalGPT: How to Use Large Language Models While Reducing Cost and Improving Performance", "Authors": "Lingjiao Chen, Matei Zaharia, James Zou", "Summary": "There is a rapidly growing number of large language models (LLMs) that users can query for a fee. We review the cost associated with querying popular LLM APIs, e.g. GPT-4, ChatGPT, J1-Jumbo, and find that these models have heterogeneous pricing structures, with fees that can differ by two orders of magnitude. In particular, using LLMs on large collections of queries and text can be expensive. Motivated by this, we outline and discuss three types of strategies that users can exploit to reduce the inference cost associated with using LLMs: 1) prompt adaptation, 2) LLM approximation, and 3) LLM cascade. As an example, we propose FrugalGPT, a simple yet flexible instantiation of LLM cascade which learns which combinations of LLMs to use for different queries in order to reduce cost and improve accuracy. Our experiments show that FrugalGPT can match the performance of the best individual LLM (e.g. GPT-4) with up to 98% cost reduction or improve the accuracy over GPT-4 by 4% with the same cost. The ideas and findings presented here lay a foundation for using LLMs sustainably and efficiently.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "FrugalGPT: A cost-effective and efficient approach to using Large Language Models", "description": "The paper introduces FrugalGPT, a novel framework that optimizes the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing cost and improving performance. FrugalGPT leverages three strategies: 1) prompt adaptation, which modifies the input prompt to get the desired output; 2) LLM approximation, which uses smaller, cheaper models to approximate the output of larger, more expensive models; and 3) LLM cascade, which uses a sequence of models to answer a query. The framework learns which combinations of LLMs to use for different queries, thereby reducing cost and improving accuracy. The authors demonstrate that FrugalGPT can match the performance of the best individual LLM with up to 98% cost reduction or improve the accuracy over the best LLM by 4% with the same cost."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "FrugalGPT offers a cost-effective and efficient way to leverage LLMs", "description": "FrugalGPT provides a practical solution for LLM practitioners looking to optimize cost and performance. By intelligently selecting and combining different LLMs based on the task at hand, FrugalGPT can significantly reduce costs while maintaining or even improving performance. This approach is particularly beneficial for high-throughput applications where the cost of using LLMs can be prohibitive. Furthermore, the strategies used by FrugalGPT - prompt adaptation, LLM approximation, and LLM cascade - can be applied individually or in combination to optimize the use of LLMs in a variety of applications.", "example": "For instance, a company could use FrugalGPT to optimize its customer service chatbot. Instead of using a single expensive LLM for all queries, the company could use FrugalGPT to select a cheaper LLM for simple queries and reserve the expensive LLM for more complex queries. This could significantly reduce costs while maintaining a high level of customer service."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "FrugalGPT introduces a novel approach to using LLMs that optimizes cost and performance. While the individual strategies used by FrugalGPT - prompt adaptation, LLM approximation, and LLM cascade - have been used before, their combination in a single framework that learns which combinations of LLMs to use for different queries is a significant advancement.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it discusses the strategies used by FrugalGPT in detail and presents experimental results to demonstrate its effectiveness. However, the concepts are explained clearly and should be accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of LLMs.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and presents a novel and practical solution to a real-world problem. The clear explanation of the strategies used by FrugalGPT and the presentation of experimental results make the paper engaging and informative.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
