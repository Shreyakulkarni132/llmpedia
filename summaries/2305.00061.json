{"Published": "2023-04-28", "Title": "Explainable Verbal Reasoner Plus (EVR+): A Natural Language Reasoning Framework that Supports Diverse Compositional Reasoning", "Authors": "Zhengzhong Liang, Zeyu Zhang, Steven Bethard, Mihai Surdeanu", "Summary": "Languages models have been successfully applied to a variety of reasoning tasks in NLP, yet the language models still suffer from compositional generalization. In this paper we present Explainable Verbal Reasoner Plus (EVR+), a reasoning framework that enhances language models' compositional reasoning ability by (1) allowing the model to explicitly generate and execute symbolic operators, and (2) allowing the model to decompose a complex task into several simpler ones in a flexible manner. Compared with its predecessor Explainable Verbal Reasoner (EVR) and other previous approaches adopting similar ideas, our framework supports more diverse types of reasoning such as nested loops and different types of recursion. To evaluate our reasoning framework, we build a synthetic dataset with five tasks that require compositional reasoning. Results show that our reasoning framework can enhance the language model's compositional generalization performance on the five tasks, using a fine-tuned language model. We also discussed the possibility and the challenges to combine our reasoning framework with a few-shot prompted language model.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "EVR+ enhances compositional reasoning ability of language models", "description": "The paper introduces Explainable Verbal Reasoner Plus (EVR+), a reasoning framework designed to improve the compositional reasoning ability of language models.

By allowing the model to generate and execute symbolic operators and decompose complex tasks into simpler ones, it can potentially improve the performance of LLMs in various tasks requiring compositional reasoning. For instance, in a task requiring the model to understand and generate a story based on a given plot, EVR+ could help the model break down the plot into smaller parts, reason about each part, and then compose the story.", "example": "For example, given a plot 'A boy finds a magic lamp. He releases a genie who grants him three wishes. He wishes for wealth, health, and happiness.', an LLM with EVR+ could decompose this into smaller tasks: 1. Understand the concept of a magic lamp and a genie. 2. Understand the concept of three wishes. 3. Generate a story based on these concepts."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to enhance the compositional reasoning ability of language models.
