{"Published": "2022-03-29", "Title": "Probing Factually Grounded Content Transfer with Factual Ablation", "Authors": "Peter West, Chris Quirk, Michel Galley, Yejin Choi", "Summary": "Despite recent success, large neural models often generate factually incorrect text. Compounding this is the lack of a standard automatic evaluation for factuality--it cannot be meaningfully improved if it cannot be measured. Grounded generation promises a path to solving both of these problems: models draw on a reliable external document (grounding) for factual information, simplifying the challenge of factuality. Measuring factuality is also simplified--to factual consistency, testing whether the generation agrees with the grounding, rather than all facts. Yet, without a standard automatic metric for factual consistency, factually grounded generation remains an open problem.   We study this problem for content transfer, in which generations extend a prompt, using information from factual grounding. Particularly, this domain allows us to introduce the notion of factual ablation for automatically measuring factual consistency: this captures the intuition that the model should be less likely to produce an output given a less relevant grounding document. In practice, we measure this by presenting a model with two grounding documents, and the model should prefer to use the more factually relevant one. We contribute two evaluation sets to measure this. Applying our new evaluation, we propose multiple novel methods improving over strong baselines.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Introduction of Factual Ablation for Measuring Factual Consistency in LLMs", "description": "The paper introduces the concept of factual ablation, a method for automatically measuring factual consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs).

This approach can be used to improve the model's performance in tasks that require factual accuracy, such as content generation and summarization.", "example": "For instance, an LLM can be presented with two grounding documents about a historical event, one accurate and one with factual errors. The model's output is then evaluated based on its alignment with the accurate document. If the model's output aligns more with the inaccurate document, the model's factual consistency can be improved using the methods proposed in the paper."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper introduces a novel concept, factual ablation, for measuring factual consistency in LLMs. This approach provides a new way to evaluate and improve the factual accuracy of LLMs, which is a significant contribution to the field.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it introduces a new concept and provides a detailed explanation of how it works.
