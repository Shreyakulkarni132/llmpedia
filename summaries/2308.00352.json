However, existing works primarily focuses on simple tasks lacking exploration and investigation in complicated tasks mainly due to the hallucination problem. This kind of hallucination gets amplified infinitely as multiple intelligent agents interact with each other, resulting in failures when tackling complicated problems.Therefore, we introduce MetaGPT, an innovative framework that infuses effective human workflows as a meta programming approach into LLM-driven multi-agent collaboration. In particular, MetaGPT first encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompts, fostering structured coordination. And then, it further mandates modular outputs, bestowing agents with domain expertise paralleling human professionals to validate outputs and reduce compounded errors. In this way, MetaGPT leverages the assembly line work model to assign diverse roles to various agents, thus establishing a framework that can effectively and cohesively deconstruct complex multi-agent collaborative problems. Our experiments conducted on collaborative software engineering tasks illustrate MetaGPT's capability in producing comprehensive solutions with higher coherence relative to existing conversational and chat-based multi-agent systems. This underscores the potential of incorporating human domain knowledge into multi-agents, thus opening up novel avenues for grappling with intricate real-world challenges.

This approach could be particularly useful in domains like software engineering, where tasks can be broken down and assigned to different agents, similar to human roles in an assembly line.", "example": "For instance, in a software development project, MetaGPT could assign different roles to agents: one for requirements analysis, another for system design, and others for coding and testing. Each agent would follow SOPs encoded into prompts and produce modular outputs, which are validated by other agents, ensuring the overall coherence and correctness of the project."}, "category": "PROMPTING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent collaboration by introducing MetaGPT, a framework that infuses human workflows into LLM-driven systems.
