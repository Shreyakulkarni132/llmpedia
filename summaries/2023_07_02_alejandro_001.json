{"Published": "2023-07-02", "Title": "Can ChatGPT Forecast Stock Price Movements? Return Predictability and Large Language Models", "Authors": "Alejandro Lopez-Lira, Yuehua Tang", "Summary": "We examine the potential of ChatGPT, and other large language models, in predicting stock market returns using sentiment analysis of news headlines. We use ChatGPT to indicate whether a given headline is good, bad, or irrelevant news for firms' stock prices. We then compute a numerical score and document a positive correlation between these ``ChatGPT scores'' and subsequent daily stock market returns. Further, ChatGPT outperforms traditional sentiment analysis methods. We find that more basic models such as GPT-1, GPT-2, and BERT cannot accurately forecast returns, indicating return predictability is an emerging capacity of complex models. ChatGPT-4's implied Sharpe ratios are larger than ChatGPT-3's; however, the latter model has larger total returns. Our results suggest that incorporating advanced language models into the investment decision-making process can yield more accurate predictions and enhance the performance of quantitative trading strategies. Predictability is concentrated on smaller stocks and more prominent on firms with bad news, consistent with limits-to-arbitrage arguments rather than market inefficiencies.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "ChatGPT shows potential in predicting stock market returns", "description": "The paper explores the use of ChatGPT, a large language model, in predicting stock market returns through sentiment analysis of news headlines.

This could potentially lead to a shift in the methods used for market prediction and investment decision-making. For LLM practitioners, this opens up a new avenue for applying these models in the financial sector, particularly in the area of stock market prediction.", "example": "For instance, an LLM practitioner could use ChatGPT to analyze news headlines and generate a sentiment score. This score could then be used as an input in a trading algorithm to predict stock market returns. The algorithm could be designed to buy stocks with high positive scores and sell stocks with high negative scores."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper is among the first to explore the use of ChatGPT in predicting stock market returns, marking a significant stride in the application of LLMs in the financial sector. The novel approach of using sentiment analysis of news headlines to generate scores that correlate with stock market returns is a unique contribution.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical as it delves into the use of ChatGPT for sentiment analysis and stock market prediction. However, it does not delve into complex mathematical theories or algorithms, making it accessible to readers with a basic understanding of LLMs and financial markets.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and presents an intriguing application of LLMs in the financial sector. The potential implications of the findings for the investment decision-making process make it an interesting read for both researchers and practitioners.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
