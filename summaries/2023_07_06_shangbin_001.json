{"Published": "2023-07-06", "Title": "From Pretraining Data to Language Models to Downstream Tasks: Tracking the Trails of Political Biases Leading to Unfair NLP Models", "Authors": "Shangbin Feng, Chan Young Park, Yuhan Liu, Yulia Tsvetkov", "Summary": "Language models (LMs) are pretrained on diverse data sources, including news, discussion forums, books, and online encyclopedias. A significant portion of this data includes opinions and perspectives which, on one hand, celebrate democracy and diversity of ideas, and on the other hand are inherently socially biased. Our work develops new methods to (1) measure political biases in LMs trained on such corpora, along social and economic axes, and (2) measure the fairness of downstream NLP models trained on top of politically biased LMs. We focus on hate speech and misinformation detection, aiming to empirically quantify the effects of political (social, economic) biases in pretraining data on the fairness of high-stakes social-oriented tasks. Our findings reveal that pretrained LMs do have political leanings that reinforce the polarization present in pretraining corpora, propagating social biases into hate speech predictions and misinformation detectors. We discuss the implications of our findings for NLP research and propose future directions to mitigate unfairness.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Measuring and Mitigating Political Bias in Large Language Models", "description": "The paper presents a novel methodology to measure political biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their impact on downstream tasks. The authors propose a two-step approach: first, they develop a framework grounded in political science literature to measure the inherent political leanings of pretrained LMs. Second, they investigate how these biases affect the performance of LMs in downstream tasks such as hate speech detection and misinformation identification. The study reveals that pretrained LMs do exhibit political biases that reinforce the polarization present in pretraining corpora, propagating social biases into downstream tasks. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for NLP research and propose future directions to mitigate unfairness."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Political Bias in LLMs Can Impact Downstream Tasks", "description": "The study highlights the importance of understanding and addressing political bias in LLMs, as it can significantly impact the performance of downstream tasks. For instance, LMs with different political biases may have different standards for what constitutes hate speech or misinformation. This can lead to unfairness in applications such as content moderation or misinformation detection. To mitigate this, the authors suggest using an ensemble of LMs with different political leanings or strategically pretraining LMs on data that reflects the specific scenarios they will be applied to.", "example": "For instance, if a content moderation model is more sensitive to offensive content directed at men than women, it can result in women being exposed to more toxic content. Similarly, if a misinformation detection model is excessively sensitive to one side of a story and detects misinformation from that side more frequently, it can create a skewed representation of the overall situation. The authors' proposed strategies can help mitigate these issues."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel methodology for measuring political bias in LLMs and its impact on downstream tasks. While previous studies have highlighted the existence of biases in LLMs, this work goes a step further by quantifying these biases along social and economic axes and investigating their effects on high-stakes social-oriented tasks such as hate speech detection and misinformation identification. The authors also propose strategies to mitigate the impact of political bias, contributing to the ongoing discussion on fairness in NLP.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, requiring a basic understanding of LLMs, their pretraining process, and their application in downstream tasks. The authors present a detailed methodology for measuring political bias in LLMs, involving the use of political science theories and the political compass test. They also delve into the technical aspects of their experiments, discussing the specific LLMs used, the partisan corpora for pretraining, and the datasets used for downstream tasks.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents a compelling investigation into the political biases of LLMs and their implications for downstream tasks. The authors' methodology is clearly explained, and their findings are presented in a way that is easy to understand. The discussion on the implications of their findings and the proposed strategies for mitigating bias add depth to the paper, making it an engaging read for those interested in the fairness and bias in LLMs.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
