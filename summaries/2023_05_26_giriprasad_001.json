{"Published": "2023-05-26", "Title": "ChatGPT: A Study on its Utility for Ubiquitous Software Engineering Tasks", "Authors": "Giriprasad Sridhara, Ranjani H. G., Sourav Mazumdar", "Summary": "ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot launched by OpenAI on November 30, 2022. OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models serve as the foundation for ChatGPT. ChatGPT is fine-tuned with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques and has received widespread attention for its articulate responses across diverse domains of knowledge. In this study, we explore how ChatGPT can be used to help with common software engineering tasks. Many of the ubiquitous tasks covering the breadth of software engineering such as ambiguity resolution in software requirements, method name suggestion, test case prioritization, code review, log summarization can potentially be performed using ChatGPT. In this study, we explore fifteen common software engineering tasks using ChatGPT. We juxtapose and analyze ChatGPT's answers with the respective state of the art outputs (where available) and/or human expert ground truth. Our experiments suggest that for many tasks, ChatGPT does perform credibly and the response from it is detailed and often better than the human expert output or the state of the art output. However, for a few other tasks, ChatGPT in its present form provides incorrect answers and hence is not suited for such tasks.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Exploration of ChatGPT's utility in common software engineering tasks", "description": "The paper investigates the application of ChatGPT, a chatbot based on OpenAI's GPT-3, in common software engineering tasks.

The performance of ChatGPT is compared with state-of-the-art outputs and human expert ground truth. The study finds that ChatGPT performs credibly in many tasks, often surpassing human expert output or state-of-the-art output.

However, it also highlights the limitations of the current model, indicating areas for improvement. For LLM practitioners, this study provides insights into the practical application of LLMs in software engineering and can guide future work in fine-tuning and application development.", "example": "For instance, ChatGPT could be used in a software development workflow to suggest method names based on the method's functionality, prioritize test cases based on their importance and potential impact, or review code for potential errors or improvements."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper's exploration of ChatGPT's utility in common software engineering tasks is a novel application of LLMs in this domain. However, the methodology of comparing the model's performance with state-of-the-art outputs and human expert ground truth is a common approach in evaluating AI models.", "novelty_score": 2, "technical_analysis": "The paper is not overly technical as it focuses more on the application of ChatGPT in software engineering tasks rather than the underlying algorithms or techniques. It is accessible to readers with a basic understanding of AI and software engineering.", "technical_score": 1, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and provides interesting insights into the practical application of LLMs in software engineering, making it an enjoyable read for those interested in this field.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
