{"Published": "2023-02-28", "Title": "ThoughtSource: A central hub for large language model reasoning data", "Authors": "Simon Ott, Konstantin Hebenstreit, Valentin Li\u00e9vin, Christoffer Egeberg Hother, Milad Moradi, Maximilian Mayrhauser, Robert Praas, Ole Winther, Matthias Samwald", "Summary": "Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT have recently demonstrated impressive results across a wide range of tasks. LLMs are still limited, however, in that they frequently fail at complex reasoning, their reasoning processes are opaque, they are prone to 'hallucinate' facts, and there are concerns about their underlying biases. Letting models verbalize reasoning steps as natural language, a technique known as chain-of-thought prompting, has recently been proposed as a way to address some of these issues. Here we present the first release of ThoughtSource, a meta-dataset and software library for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. The goal of ThoughtSource is to improve future artificial intelligence systems by facilitating qualitative understanding of CoTs, enabling empirical evaluations, and providing training data. This first release of ThoughtSource integrates six scientific/medical, three general-domain and five math word question answering datasets.", "main_contribution": "The paper introduces ThoughtSource, a meta-dataset and software library for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. ThoughtSource is designed to improve future AI systems by facilitating qualitative understanding of CoTs, enabling empirical evaluations, and providing training data. The first release of ThoughtSource integrates a variety of datasets from different domains, including six scientific/medical, three general-domain, and five math word question answering datasets.", "takeaways": "ThoughtSource provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working with LLMs. It can help in understanding and improving the reasoning capabilities of these models, and in evaluating their performance. The integration of diverse datasets also makes ThoughtSource a versatile tool for training LLMs for a wide range of tasks.", "novelty_analysis": "ThoughtSource represents a novel contribution in the field of LLMs. While the concept of CoT prompting has been previously proposed, the creation of a dedicated meta-dataset and software library for CoT reasoning is a unique and significant advancement.", "novelty_score": 3, "category": "TRAINING", "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it discusses the concept of CoT prompting and the structure and use of the ThoughtSource meta-dataset and software library. However, it does not delve into the technical details of LLM architectures or training methods.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it relatively easy to follow. The introduction of ThoughtSource and its potential applications in improving LLMs make it an interesting read for those in the field.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
