{"Published": "2022-11-24", "Title": "Prototypical Fine-tuning: Towards Robust Performance Under Varying Data Sizes", "Authors": "Yiqiao Jin, Xiting Wang, Yaru Hao, Yizhou Sun, Xing Xie", "Summary": "In this paper, we move towards combining large parametric models with non-parametric prototypical networks. We propose prototypical fine-tuning, a novel prototypical framework for fine-tuning pretrained language models (LM), which automatically learns a bias to improve predictive performance for varying data sizes, especially low-resource settings. Our prototypical fine-tuning approach can automatically adjust the model capacity according to the number of data points and the model's inherent attributes. Moreover, we propose four principles for effective prototype fine-tuning towards the optimal solution. Experimental results across various datasets show that our work achieves significant performance improvements under various low-resource settings, as well as comparable and usually better performances in high-resource scenarios.", "main_contribution": "The paper introduces a novel framework called Prototypical Fine-tuning (PFit) that combines large parametric models with non-parametric prototypical networks. The PFit method represents the data within each class as a set of prototypes, each modeled as a mixture component, while learning the number of components automatically based on the model capacity and the complexity of data distribution. This approach is designed to improve predictive performance on varying sizes of datasets, especially for low-resource settings.", "takeaways": "The PFit method offers a unique approach to fine-tuning pretrained language models, particularly in low-resource settings. It automatically adjusts the model capacity according to the number of data points and the model's inherent attributes, which can be beneficial for LLM practitioners working with varying data sizes. The experimental results show significant performance improvements under various low-resource settings, as well as comparable and usually better performances in high-resource scenarios.", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of the PFit method represents a significant advancement in the field of fine-tuning pretrained language models.
