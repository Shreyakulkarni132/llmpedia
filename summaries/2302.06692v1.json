Intrinsically motivated exploration methods address this limitation by rewarding agents for visiting novel states or transitions, but these methods offer limited benefits in large environments where most discovered novelty is irrelevant for downstream tasks. We describe a method that uses background knowledge from text corpora to shape exploration. This method, called ELLM (Exploring with LLMs) rewards an agent for achieving goals suggested by a language model prompted with a description of the agent's current state. By leveraging large-scale language model pretraining, ELLM guides agents toward human-meaningful and plausibly useful behaviors without requiring a human in the loop. We evaluate ELLM in the Crafter game environment and the Housekeep robotic simulator, showing that ELLM-trained agents have better coverage of common-sense behaviors during pretraining and usually match or improve performance on a range of downstream tasks.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "ELLM: A novel method for guiding reinforcement learning with large language models", "description": "The paper introduces ELLM (Exploring with LLMs), a method that uses background knowledge from text corpora to shape exploration in reinforcement learning.

By prompting the LLM with the agent's current state, the model suggests goals that the agent should strive to achieve. This approach can be particularly useful in large environments where traditional exploration methods struggle due to the vastness of the state space. The demonstrated effectiveness of ELLM in game and robotic simulation environments suggests potential applications in other complex, large-scale tasks.", "example": "For instance, in a game environment, an agent's current state could be 'You are in a forest with trees, a river, and a wooden axe in your inventory.' The LLM might suggest the goal 'Build a raft to cross the river.' The agent is then rewarded for achieving this goal, guiding its learning process."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to guiding reinforcement learning using large language models. The concept of using an LLM to suggest goals based on the agent's current state is a unique contribution that extends the capabilities of reinforcement learning in large environments.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, discussing the implementation of the ELLM method and its application in different environments. However, the concepts are explained clearly, making it accessible to readers with a basic understanding of reinforcement learning and language models.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents an interesting approach to reinforcement learning. The use of practical examples and clear explanations makes it an enjoyable read for those interested in the application of language models in reinforcement learning.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
