In this paper, we formulate text generation as progressively copying text segments (e.g., words or phrases) from an existing text collection. We compute the contextualized representations of meaningful text segments and index them using efficient vector search toolkits. The task of text generation is then decomposed into a series of copy-and-paste operations: at each time step, we seek suitable text spans from the text collection rather than selecting from a standalone vocabulary. Experiments on the standard language modeling benchmark (WikiText-103) show that our approach achieves better generation quality according to both automatic and human evaluations. Besides, its inference efficiency is comparable to token-level autoregressive models thanks to the reduction of decoding steps. We also show that our approach allows for effective domain adaptation by simply switching to domain-specific text collection without extra training. Finally, we observe that our approach attains additional performance gains by simply scaling up to larger text collections, again without further training.\\footnote{Our source codes are publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/gmftbyGMFTBY/Copyisallyouneed}.}", "main_contribution": {"headline": "COG: A novel text generation model using copy-and-paste operations", "description": "The paper introduces a new text generation model, COG (short for COPY-GENERATOR), which reformulates text generation as a series of copy-and-paste operations from an existing text collection. Unlike traditional models that generate text by sequentially selecting words from a fixed vocabulary, COG computes contextualized representations of text segments (words or phrases) and indexes them. At each decoding step, a suitable phrase is retrieved from the index and appended to the current prefix. This approach allows for more accurate candidate representation and selection, training-free adaptation to new knowledge sources, and improved inference efficiency by reducing the total number of decoding steps."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "COG offers a new approach to text generation with potential for domain adaptation", "description": "COG's approach to text generation, which involves copying and pasting text segments from an existing collection, offers a new perspective for LLM practitioners. It allows for more accurate representation and selection of candidates, and its plug-and-play nature allows for easy adaptation to new domains without additional training. Additionally, the reduction in decoding steps could lead to improved inference efficiency. However, the practicality of this approach may depend on the availability and quality of the text collection used.", "example": "For instance, if you're working on a domain-specific task, you can simply switch to a domain-specific text collection with COG, without the need for extra training. The model will then generate text by copying and pasting suitable phrases from this collection, potentially improving the quality and relevance of the generated text."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to text generation, moving away from the traditional method of selecting words from a fixed vocabulary to copying and pasting text segments from an existing collection. This approach, along with the introduction of the COG model, represents a significant departure from existing methods.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, discussing the workings of the COG model and its implementation. However, it does not delve into complex mathematical theories or algorithms, making it accessible to readers with a basic understanding of language models and text generation.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents an interesting and novel approach to text generation. The introduction of the COG model and its potential applications make for an engaging read.
