{"Published": "2020-06-21", "Title": "UO2/BeO interfacial thermal resistance and its effect on fuel thermal conductivity", "Authors": "Xueyan Zhu, Rui Gao, Hengfeng Gong, Tong Liu, De-Ye Lin, Haifeng Song", "Summary": "UO2/BeO interfacial thermal resistance (ITR) is calculated by diffuse mismatch model (DMM) and the effects of ITR on UO2-BeO thermal conductivity are investigated. ITR predicted by DMM is on the order of 10-9 m2K/W. Using this ITR, UO2-BeO thermal conductivities are calculated by theoretical models and compared with experimental data. The results indicate that DMM prediction is applicable to the interface between UO2 and dispersed BeO, while not applicable to the interface between UO2 and continuous BeO. If the thermal conductivity of UO2 containing continuous BeO was to be in agreement with experimental data, its ITR should be on the order of 10-6 - 10-5 m2K/W. Therefore, the vibrational mismatch between UO2 and BeO considered by DMM is the major mechanism for attenuating the heat flux through UO2/dispersed-BeO interface, but not for UO2/continuous-BeO interface. Furthermore, it is found that the presence of ITR leads to the dependence of the thermal conductivity of UO2 containing dispersed BeO on BeO size. With the decrease in BeO size, UO2-BeO thermal conductivity decreases. When BeO size is smaller than a critical value, UO2-BeO thermal conductivity becomes even smaller than UO2 thermal conductivity. For UO2 containing continuous BeO, the thermal conductivity decreases with the decrease in the size of UO2 granule surrounded by BeO, but not necessarily smaller than UO2 thermal conductivity. Under a critical temperature, UO2-BeO thermal conductivity is always larger than UO2 thermal conductivity. Above the critical temperature, UO2-BeO thermal conductivity is larger than UO2 thermal conductivity only when UO2 granule size is large enough. The conditions for achieving the targeted enhancement of UO2 thermal conductivity by doping with BeO are derived. These conditions can be used to design and optimize the distribution, content, size of BeO, and the size of UO2 granule.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Understanding the Impact of Interfacial Thermal Resistance on UO2-BeO Thermal Conductivity", "description": "This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the interfacial thermal resistance (ITR) between uranium dioxide (UO2) and beryllium oxide (BeO) and its impact on their combined thermal conductivity.
