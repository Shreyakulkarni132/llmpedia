An LAA is able to generate actions with its core LLM and interact with environments, which facilitates the ability to resolve complex tasks by conditioning on past interactions such as observations and actions. Since the investigation of LAA is still very recent, limited explorations are available. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive comparison of LAA in terms of both agent architectures and LLM backbones. Additionally, we propose a new strategy to orchestrate multiple LAAs such that each labor LAA focuses on one type of action, \\textit{i.e.} BOLAA, where a controller manages the communication among multiple agents. We conduct simulations on both decision-making and multi-step reasoning environments, which comprehensively justify the capacity of LAAs. Our performance results provide quantitative suggestions for designing LAA architectures and the optimal choice of LLMs, as well as the compatibility of both. We release our implementation code of LAAs to the public at \\url{https://github.com/salesforce/BOLAA}.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "BOLAA: Orchestrating Multiple LLM-Augmented Autonomous Agents", "description": "The paper introduces a new strategy, BOLAA, for orchestrating multiple LLM-augmented Autonomous Agents (LAAs).

By having each LAA specialize in a specific type of action, and using a controller to manage communication among the agents, the system can handle complex tasks more efficiently. The authors' comprehensive comparison of LAAs and their performance results can guide practitioners in designing LAA architectures and choosing the optimal LLMs for their systems.", "example": "For instance, in a customer service chatbot system, different LAAs could specialize in understanding customer queries, retrieving relevant information, and generating responses. The BOLAA controller would manage the communication among these agents, ensuring that the system works together effectively to provide accurate and helpful responses to customers."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of the BOLAA strategy for orchestrating multiple LAAs is a novel contribution. While LAAs have been explored in previous work, this paper presents a new approach to managing multiple agents and enhancing their performance through specialization and orchestration.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it delves into the design of LAA architectures and the use of different LLM backbones. However, the concepts are explained clearly, and the paper should be accessible to readers with a background in AI and machine learning.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents an interesting approach to managing multiple LAAs. The comprehensive comparison of LAAs and the detailed performance results make for an engaging read.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
