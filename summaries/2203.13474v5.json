{"Published": "2023-02-27", "Title": "CodeGen: An Open Large Language Model for Code with Multi-Turn Program Synthesis", "Authors": "Erik Nijkamp, Bo Pang, Hiroaki Hayashi, Lifu Tu, Huan Wang, Yingbo Zhou, Silvio Savarese, Caiming Xiong", "Summary": "Program synthesis strives to generate a computer program as a solution to a given problem specification, expressed with input-output examples or natural language descriptions. The prevalence of large language models advances the state-of-the-art for program synthesis, though limited training resources and data impede open access to such models. To democratize this, we train and release a family of large language models up to 16.1B parameters, called CODEGEN, on natural language and programming language data, and open source the training library JAXFORMER. We show the utility of the trained model by demonstrating that it is competitive with the previous state-of-the-art on zero-shot Python code generation on HumanEval. We further investigate the multi-step paradigm for program synthesis, where a single program is factorized into multiple prompts specifying subproblems. To this end, we construct an open benchmark, Multi-Turn Programming Benchmark (MTPB), consisting of 115 diverse problem sets that are factorized into multi-turn prompts. Our analysis on MTPB shows that the same intent provided to CODEGEN in multi-turn fashion significantly improves program synthesis over that provided as a single turn. We make the training library JAXFORMER and model checkpoints available as open source contribution: https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "CODEGEN: A Large Language Model for Code Generation and Multi-Turn Program Synthesis", "description": "The paper introduces CODEGEN, a family of large language models trained on natural language and programming language data, with up to 16.1 billion parameters.

The model can be used to generate Python code in a zero-shot manner, demonstrating its potential for practical applications in software development. The open-source nature of the project allows practitioners to use and further develop the model and the training library. The multi-turn approach to program synthesis could be used to break down complex programming tasks into manageable subproblems, potentially making the coding process more efficient.", "example": "For instance, a complex programming task could be broken down into multiple prompts, each specifying a subproblem. These prompts could be fed into CODEGEN in a sequential manner, with the output of one prompt serving as the input for the next, resulting in a final program that solves the original complex task."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of CODEGEN, a large language model specifically trained for code generation, and the multi-step paradigm for program synthesis represent significant advancements in the field of program synthesis.
