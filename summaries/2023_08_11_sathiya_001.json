However, the absence of a cohesive approach leads to a challenging learning curve, heightened errors, and inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to facilitate a natural-language-based network management experience, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to generate task-specific code from natural language queries. This method tackles the challenges of explainability, scalability, and privacy by allowing network operators to inspect the generated code, eliminating the need to share network data with LLMs, and concentrating on application-specific requests combined with general program synthesis techniques. We design and evaluate a prototype system using benchmark applications, showcasing high accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and the potential for further enhancements using complementary program synthesis techniques.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Natural-Language-Based Network Management Using Large Language Models", "description": "The paper introduces a novel approach to network management using large language models (LLMs) to generate task-specific code from natural language queries.

The generated code can be inspected, ensuring transparency and trust in the system. The approach also eliminates the need to share sensitive network data with LLMs, addressing privacy concerns. This method can be applied to build systems that simplify network management, reduce errors, and improve efficiency. The prototype system's high accuracy and cost-effectiveness suggest that this approach could be used to develop practical applications for network management.", "example": "For instance, a network operator could use a natural language query like 'What is the most cost-efficient way to double the network bandwidth between these two data centers?' The LLM would generate task-specific code to answer this query, which the operator could then inspect and execute."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to network management using large language models. While LLMs have been used in various domains, their application in network management, particularly in generating task-specific code from natural language queries, is a unique contribution.
