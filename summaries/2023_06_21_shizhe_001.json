As the technique keeps attracting attention from the AI community, more and more large foundation models have become publically available. However, most of those models exhibit a major deficiency in specialized-task applications, where the step of finetuning is still required for obtaining satisfactory performance. As the number of available models and specialized tasks keeps growing, the job of general finetuning becomes highly nontrivial. In this paper, we take the first step to address this issue. We introduce an extensible and lightweight toolkit, LMFlow, which aims to simplify the finetuning and inference of general large foundation models. LMFlow offers a complete finetuning workflow for a large foundation model to support personalized training with limited computing resources. Furthermore, it supports continuous pretraining, instruction tuning, parameter-efficient finetuning, alignment tuning, and large model inference, along with carefully designed and extensible APIs. This toolkit has been thoroughly tested and is available at https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "LMFlow: An Extensible Toolkit for Finetuning and Inference of Large Foundation Models", "description": "The paper introduces LMFlow, a toolkit designed to simplify the finetuning and inference of large foundation models.

It simplifies the process of finetuning these models for specialized tasks, making it easier to achieve satisfactory performance. The toolkit supports a range of techniques, including continuous pretraining, instruction tuning, parameter-efficient finetuning, and alignment tuning. It also provides a simplified model inference framework. With LMFlow, anyone can train their own personalized model, choosing the appropriate model for their available resources and tasks. The toolkit has been thoroughly tested and is available on GitHub.", "example": "For example, a researcher working on a specialized task such as medical diagnosis could use LMFlow to finetune a large foundation model on a dataset of medical records. The toolkit would guide the researcher through the process of continuous pretraining, instruction tuning, and alignment tuning, ultimately producing a model that performs well on the task. The researcher could then use the toolkit's inference capabilities to deploy the model and make predictions on new data."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "LMFlow represents a significant contribution to the field of large language models. While many large foundation models are publicly available, there has been a lack of toolkits that simplify the process of finetuning these models for specialized tasks. LMFlow addresses this gap, providing a comprehensive and extensible toolkit that supports a range of finetuning techniques and offers a simplified model inference framework.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, providing a detailed description of the LMFlow toolkit and its capabilities. It discusses various techniques for finetuning large foundation models, including continuous pretraining, instruction tuning, parameter-efficient finetuning, and alignment tuning.
