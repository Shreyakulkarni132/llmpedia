{"Published": "2023-06-28", "Title": "Extending Context Window of Large Language Models via Positional Interpolation", "Authors": "Shouyuan Chen, Sherman Wong, Liangjian Chen, Yuandong Tian", "Summary": "We present Position Interpolation (PI) that extends the context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained LLMs such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal fine-tuning (within 1000 steps), while demonstrating strong empirical results on various tasks that require long context, including passkey retrieval, language modeling, and long document summarization from LLaMA 7B to 65B. Meanwhile, the extended model by Position Interpolation preserve quality relatively well on tasks within its original context window. To achieve this goal, Position Interpolation linearly down-scales the input position indices to match the original context window size, rather than extrapolating beyond the trained context length which may lead to catastrophically high attention scores that completely ruin the self-attention mechanism. Our theoretical study shows that the upper bound of interpolation is at least $\\sim 600 \\times$ smaller than that of extrapolation, further demonstrating its stability. Models extended via Position Interpolation retain its original architecture and can reuse most pre-existing optimization and infrastructure.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Position Interpolation Extends Context Window of Large Language Models", "description": "The paper introduces Position Interpolation (PI), a method that extends the context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal fine-tuning.

This can be particularly useful in applications that require long conversations, summarizing long documents, or executing long-term planning. The method also preserves the model's quality relatively well for tasks within its original context window sizes. The paper also provides theoretical insights into why interpolation achieves much more stable results than extrapolation.", "example": "For instance, if you have a pre-trained LLaMA model with a context window of 2048 tokens and you want to extend it to handle 4096 tokens, you can use Position Interpolation to downscale the position indices from [0, 4096] to [0, 2048] and then fine-tune the model for about 1000 steps. This will allow the model to handle the longer context window without significant degradation in performance."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to extending the context window of pre-trained LLMs. While previous methods have attempted to achieve this through fine-tuning or length extrapolation, this is the first work to propose Position Interpolation as a solution. The method's ability to extend the context window with minimal fine-tuning and its strong empirical results make it a significant contribution to the field.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is quite technical, delving into the details of the Position Interpolation method, including its theoretical underpinnings and empirical results. It requires a solid understanding of LLMs, attention mechanisms, and the concept of context windows. The paper also includes mathematical proofs and equations to support its claims, adding to its technical depth.", "technical_score": 3, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and provides a clear explanation of the Position Interpolation method, its theoretical basis, and its empirical results. The inclusion of visual illustrations aids in understanding the method and its effects. However, the technical depth of the paper and the mathematical proofs may make it a challenging read for those without a strong background in the field.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
