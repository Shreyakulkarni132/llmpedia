{"Published": "2023-06-21", "Title": "Understanding Social Reasoning in Language Models with Language Models", "Authors": "Kanishk Gandhi, Jan-Philipp Fr\u00e4nken, Tobias Gerstenberg, Noah D. Goodman", "Summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our everyday lives, understanding their ability to comprehend human mental states becomes critical for ensuring effective interactions. However, despite the recent attempts to assess the Theory-of-Mind (ToM) reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the degree to which these models can align with human ToM remains a nuanced topic of exploration. This is primarily due to two distinct challenges: (1) the presence of inconsistent results from previous evaluations, and (2) concerns surrounding the validity of existing evaluation methodologies. To address these challenges, we present a novel framework for procedurally generating evaluations with LLMs by populating causal templates. Using our framework, we create a new social reasoning benchmark (BigToM) for LLMs which consists of 25 controls and 5,000 model-written evaluations. We find that human participants rate the quality of our benchmark higher than previous crowd-sourced evaluations and comparable to expert-written evaluations. Using BigToM, we evaluate the social reasoning capabilities of a variety of LLMs and compare model performances with human performance. Our results suggest that GPT4 has ToM capabilities that mirror human inference patterns, though less reliable, while other LLMs struggle.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Novel framework for evaluating social reasoning in LLMs and a new benchmark, BigToM", "description": "The paper introduces a novel framework for evaluating the social reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing the challenges of inconsistent results and concerns about the validity of existing evaluation methodologies.

The results also highlight the potential of GPT4 in applications requiring social reasoning, although its reliability needs to be improved. The procedural generation approach used in the framework can also be applied to other evaluation tasks.", "example": "For instance, using the new framework, an LLM practitioner can generate a set of evaluations for a specific LLM by populating causal templates. These evaluations can then be used to assess the LLM's social reasoning capabilities, providing insights into its performance and potential areas for improvement."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel framework for evaluating the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs, addressing the limitations of previous methodologies.
