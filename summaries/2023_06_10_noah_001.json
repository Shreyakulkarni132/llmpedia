{"Published": "2023-06-10", "Title": "Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning", "Authors": "Noah Shinn, Federico Cassano, Beck Labash, Ashwin Gopinath, Karthik Narasimhan, Shunyu Yao", "Summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to interact with external environments (e.g., games, compilers, APIs) as goal-driven agents. However, it remains challenging for these language agents to quickly and efficiently learn from trial-and-error as traditional reinforcement learning methods require extensive training samples and expensive model fine-tuning. We propose Reflexion, a novel framework to reinforce language agents not by updating weights, but instead through linguistic feedback. Concretely, Reflexion agents verbally reflect on task feedback signals, then maintain their own reflective text in an episodic memory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent trials. Reflexion is flexible enough to incorporate various types (scalar values or free-form language) and sources (external or internally simulated) of feedback signals, and obtains significant improvements over a baseline agent across diverse tasks (sequential decision-making, coding, language reasoning). For example, Reflexion achieves a 91% pass@1 accuracy on the HumanEval coding benchmark, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art GPT-4 that achieves 80%. We also conduct ablation and analysis studies using different feedback signals, feedback incorporation methods, and agent types, and provide insights into how they affect performance.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Reflexion: A novel framework for verbal reinforcement learning in LLMs", "description": "The paper introduces Reflexion, a new framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to learn from their mistakes using verbal reinforcement. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning methods that require extensive training samples and model fine-tuning, Reflexion uses linguistic feedback to guide the learning process. The agents in Reflexion verbally reflect on task feedback signals and store this reflective text in an episodic memory buffer, which helps them make better decisions in subsequent trials. The framework is flexible and can incorporate various types and sources of feedback signals. It has shown significant improvements over a baseline agent across diverse tasks."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Reflexion offers a new approach to reinforcement learning in LLMs", "description": "Reflexion provides a novel way for LLMs to learn from their mistakes, which could be particularly useful in applications where traditional reinforcement learning methods are impractical due to the need for extensive training samples and model fine-tuning. By using linguistic feedback, Reflexion allows LLMs to reflect on their actions and improve their performance in subsequent trials. This approach could be used to enhance the performance of LLMs in a variety of tasks, from sequential decision-making to coding and language reasoning.", "example": "For instance, an LLM using Reflexion could be used to interact with a game environment. After each action, the LLM would receive feedback from the environment, convert this feedback into a textual summary, and store this summary in its episodic memory buffer. In the next trial, the LLM would use this stored feedback to guide its decision-making, potentially leading to improved performance."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "Reflexion introduces a novel approach to reinforcement learning in LLMs, using linguistic feedback to guide the learning process.
