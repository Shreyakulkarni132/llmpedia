{"Published": "2023-07-08", "Title": "A Stitch in Time Saves Nine: Detecting and Mitigating Hallucinations of LLMs by Validating Low-Confidence Generation", "Authors": "Neeraj Varshney, Wenlin Yao, Hongming Zhang, Jianshu Chen, Dong Yu", "Summary": "Recently developed large language models have achieved remarkable success in generating fluent and coherent text. However, these models often tend to 'hallucinate' which critically hampers their reliability. In this work, we address this crucial problem and propose an approach that actively detects and mitigates hallucinations during the generation process. Specifically, we first identify the candidates of potential hallucination leveraging the model's logit output values, check their correctness through a validation procedure, mitigate the detected hallucinations, and then continue with the generation process. Through extensive experiments with the 'article generation task', we first demonstrate the individual efficacy of our detection and mitigation techniques. Specifically, the detection technique achieves a recall of 88% and the mitigation technique successfully mitigates 57.6% of the correctly detected hallucinations. Importantly, our mitigation technique does not introduce new hallucinations even in the case of incorrectly detected hallucinations, i.e., false positives. Then, we show that the proposed active detection and mitigation approach successfully reduces the hallucinations of the GPT-3 model from 47.5% to 14.5% on average. In summary, our work contributes to improving the reliability and trustworthiness of large language models, a crucial step en route to enabling their widespread adoption in real-world applications.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Active detection and mitigation of hallucinations in Large Language Models", "description": "The paper introduces a novel approach to detect and mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) during the generation process. Hallucinations refer to the generation of text that is syntactically sound but factually incorrect or nonsensical. The authors propose a method that identifies potential hallucinations using the model's logit output values, validates their correctness, and mitigates the detected hallucinations. The proposed method significantly reduces the hallucinations of the GPT-3 model from 47.5% to 14.5% on average, thereby improving the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Active hallucination detection and mitigation enhances LLM reliability", "description": "The proposed method of actively detecting and mitigating hallucinations can significantly improve the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications. By identifying potential hallucinations using the model's logit output values and validating their correctness, the method ensures that the generated text is not only syntactically sound but also factually correct. This approach can be particularly useful in applications where the accuracy of the generated text is critical, such as news generation, legal document drafting, or medical advice generation.", "example": "For instance, in a news generation task, the proposed method can be used to actively detect and mitigate hallucinations. If the model generates a sentence that is identified as a potential hallucination, the method would validate its correctness and mitigate it if it is indeed a hallucination, ensuring that the final generated news article is factually correct."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to actively detect and mitigate hallucinations in LLMs during the generation process.
