{"Published": "2023-06-25", "Title": "Language models are weak learners", "Authors": "Hariharan Manikandan, Yiding Jiang, J Zico Kolter", "Summary": "A central notion in practical and theoretical machine learning is that of a $\\textit{weak learner}$, classifiers that achieve better-than-random performance (on any given distribution over data), even by a small margin. Such weak learners form the practical basis for canonical machine learning methods such as boosting. In this work, we illustrate that prompt-based large language models can operate effectively as said weak learners. Specifically, we illustrate the use of a large language model (LLM) as a weak learner in a boosting algorithm applied to tabular data. We show that by providing (properly sampled according to the distribution of interest) text descriptions of tabular data samples, LLMs can produce a summary of the samples that serves as a template for classification and achieves the aim of acting as a weak learner on this task. We incorporate these models into a boosting approach, which in some settings can leverage the knowledge within the LLM to outperform traditional tree-based boosting. The model outperforms both few-shot learning and occasionally even more involved fine-tuning procedures, particularly for tasks involving small numbers of data points. The results illustrate the potential for prompt-based LLMs to function not just as few-shot learners themselves, but as components of larger machine learning pipelines.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Large Language Models as Weak Learners in Boosting Frameworks", "description": "The paper presents an innovative approach of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as weak learners in a boosting framework, specifically for tabular data. The authors demonstrate that by converting tabular data to text form and prompting LLMs to summarize a carefully chosen set of examples from the data, a summary can be produced that serves as a template for a tabular data classifier. This approach allows LLMs to act as weak learners, achieving better-than-random performance on any given distribution over data.
