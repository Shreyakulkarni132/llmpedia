{"Published": "2022-10-24", "Title": "SPOT: Knowledge-Enhanced Language Representations for Information Extraction", "Authors": "Jiacheng Li, Yannis Katsis, Tyler Baldwin, Ho-Cheol Kim, Andrew Bartko, Julian McAuley, Chun-Nan Hsu", "Summary": "Knowledge-enhanced pre-trained models for language representation have been shown to be more effective in knowledge base construction tasks (i.e.,~relation extraction) than language models such as BERT. These knowledge-enhanced language models incorporate knowledge into pre-training to generate representations of entities or relationships. However, existing methods typically represent each entity with a separate embedding. As a result, these methods struggle to represent out-of-vocabulary entities and a large amount of parameters, on top of their underlying token models (i.e.,~the transformer), must be used and the number of entities that can be handled is limited in practice due to memory constraints. Moreover, existing models still struggle to represent entities and relationships simultaneously. To address these problems, we propose a new pre-trained model that learns representations of both entities and relationships from token spans and span pairs in the text respectively. By encoding spans efficiently with span modules, our model can represent both entities and their relationships but requires fewer parameters than existing models. We pre-trained our model with the knowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia and test it on a broad range of supervised and unsupervised information extraction tasks. Results show that our model learns better representations for both entities and relationships than baselines, while in supervised settings, fine-tuning our model outperforms RoBERTa consistently and achieves competitive results on information extraction tasks.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "SPOT: A new pre-trained model for efficient representation of entities and relationships", "description": "The paper introduces SPOT, a novel pre-trained model that efficiently learns representations of both entities and relationships from token spans and span pairs in text. Unlike existing models that struggle with out-of-vocabulary entities and require a large number of parameters, SPOT uses span modules to encode spans, requiring fewer parameters. It also addresses the challenge of representing entities and relationships simultaneously. The model is pre-trained with a knowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia and has shown superior performance in both supervised and unsupervised information extraction tasks."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "SPOT offers efficient and effective entity and relationship representation", "description": "SPOT's ability to efficiently represent both entities and their relationships can be leveraged to improve the performance of LLMs in information extraction tasks. Its efficient encoding of spans with span modules reduces the number of required parameters, making it a more memory-efficient choice for handling large datasets. Furthermore, its superior performance in both supervised and unsupervised settings suggests its potential for a wide range of applications.", "example": "For instance, an LLM practitioner could use SPOT to extract and represent entities and their relationships from a large corpus of text, such as news articles or scientific papers. This could then be used to build a knowledge graph or to feed into downstream tasks like question answering or text summarization."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to the problem of entity and relationship representation in pre-trained models.
