{"Published": "2022-03-15", "Title": "Evaluating the Text-to-SQL Capabilities of Large Language Models", "Authors": "Nitarshan Rajkumar, Raymond Li, Dzmitry Bahdanau", "Summary": "We perform an empirical evaluation of Text-to-SQL capabilities of the Codex language model. We find that, without any finetuning, Codex is a strong baseline on the Spider benchmark; we also analyze the failure modes of Codex in this setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate on the GeoQuery and Scholar benchmarks that a small number of in-domain examples provided in the prompt enables Codex to perform better than state-of-the-art models finetuned on such few-shot examples.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Codex language model exhibits strong Text-to-SQL capabilities without finetuning", "description": "This paper empirically evaluates the Text-to-SQL capabilities of the Codex language model.

This could be particularly useful in building user-friendly database querying systems where users can input queries in natural language. Furthermore, the ability of Codex to improve its performance with a small number of in-domain examples in the prompt can be leveraged to adapt the model to specific domains or tasks.", "example": "For instance, an application could be built where users input natural language queries like 'Show me all employees who joined in the last six months'. Codex can then translate this into an SQL query like 'SELECT * FROM employees WHERE join_date > DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)'."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents an empirical evaluation of the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Codex, a task that has not been extensively studied before. However, the approach of using large language models for Text-to-SQL tasks is not entirely new, and the paper does not introduce any new techniques or algorithms.", "novelty_score": 2, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical as it involves an empirical evaluation of a language model on a specific task. However, it does not delve into the details of the model architecture or training process, and the concepts discussed should be reasonably understandable to someone with a background in machine learning or natural language processing.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents interesting findings about the capabilities of the Codex language model. The analysis of the model's performance and failure modes provides valuable insights. However, the paper might not be very engaging for readers who are not particularly interested in Text-to-SQL tasks.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
