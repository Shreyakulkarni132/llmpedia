To achieve intelligent teaching, the machine learning community becomes to think about a promising topic named machine teaching where the teacher is to design the optimal (usually minimal) teaching set given a target model and a specific learner. However, previous works usually require numerous teaching examples along with large iterations to guide learners to converge, which is costly. In this paper, we consider a more intelligent teaching paradigm named one-shot machine teaching which costs fewer examples to converge faster. Different from typical teaching, this advanced paradigm establishes a tractable mapping from the teaching set to the model parameter. Theoretically, we prove that this mapping is surjective, which serves to an existence guarantee of the optimal teaching set. Then, relying on the surjective mapping from the teaching set to the parameter, we develop a design strategy of the optimal teaching set under appropriate settings, of which two popular efficiency metrics, teaching dimension and iterative teaching dimension are one. Extensive experiments verify the efficiency of our strategy and further demonstrate the intelligence of this new teaching paradigm.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "One-shot Machine Teaching: A New Paradigm for Faster Convergence with Fewer Examples", "description": "The paper introduces a novel teaching paradigm called 'one-shot machine teaching', which aims to reduce the number of examples and iterations needed for machine learning models to converge. Unlike traditional teaching methods, this paradigm establishes a surjective mapping from the teaching set to the model parameter, ensuring the existence of an optimal teaching set. The authors develop a strategy for designing the optimal teaching set under appropriate settings, using popular efficiency metrics like teaching dimension and iterative teaching dimension. The effectiveness of this strategy is validated through extensive experiments."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "One-shot Machine Teaching Offers Efficiency in Training LLMs", "description": "The one-shot machine teaching paradigm can be a game-changer for LLM practitioners, as it promises faster convergence with fewer examples. This approach can significantly reduce the computational resources and time required for training LLMs. The surjective mapping from the teaching set to the model parameter ensures the existence of an optimal teaching set, which can be leveraged to design efficient training strategies. However, the practical implementation of this paradigm might require careful consideration of the appropriate settings and efficiency metrics.", "example": "For instance, in training an LLM for a specific task, instead of using a large dataset and numerous iterations, one could use the one-shot machine teaching paradigm to identify an optimal, minimal teaching set. This set, when mapped to the model parameters, would guide the LLM to converge faster, saving computational resources and time."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel teaching paradigm, 'one-shot machine teaching', which is a significant departure from traditional machine teaching methods.
