{"Published": "2021-10-04", "Title": "Structured abbreviation expansion in context", "Authors": "Kyle Gorman, Christo Kirov, Brian Roark, Richard Sproat", "Summary": "Ad hoc abbreviations are commonly found in informal communication channels that favor shorter messages. We consider the task of reversing these abbreviations in context to recover normalized, expanded versions of abbreviated messages. The problem is related to, but distinct from, spelling correction, in that ad hoc abbreviations are intentional and may involve substantial differences from the original words. Ad hoc abbreviations are productively generated on-the-fly, so they cannot be resolved solely by dictionary lookup. We generate a large, open-source data set of ad hoc abbreviations. This data is used to study abbreviation strategies and to develop two strong baselines for abbreviation expansion", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Large dataset and two baseline models for ad hoc abbreviation expansion", "description": "The paper presents a large, open-source dataset of ad hoc abbreviations, which are commonly found in informal communication channels. These abbreviations are neither frequent nor conventionalized, and are generated on-the-fly, making them challenging to resolve solely by dictionary lookup. The authors also introduce two strong baseline models for abbreviation expansion, one finite-state and one neural. Both models use a noisy channel approach, combining an abbreviation model and a language model to enforce fluency and local coherence in the expansion."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Ad hoc abbreviation expansion can improve text normalization in LLMs", "description": "The dataset and models presented in this paper can be used to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tasks involving text normalization, particularly in the context of informal communication channels. By training an LLM on the provided dataset, it can learn to expand ad hoc abbreviations with human-like accuracy. This can be particularly useful in applications such as chatbots, social media analysis, and other areas where informal and abbreviated text is common.", "example": "For instance, an LLM trained on this dataset could be used in a chatbot application to expand user inputs that contain ad hoc abbreviations, improving the chatbot's understanding of the user's messages. For example, a user input like 'I'm gng to the str' could be expanded to 'I'm going to the store', allowing the chatbot to respond appropriately."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The creation of a large, open-source dataset of ad hoc abbreviations and the development of two strong baseline models for abbreviation expansion represent significant contributions to the field of text normalization. However, the use of a noisy channel approach for abbreviation expansion is not entirely novel, as similar approaches have been used in other areas of natural language processing.", "novelty_score": 2, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it involves the development of two models for abbreviation expansion and the creation of a large dataset. However, the concepts and techniques used are well-explained and should be accessible to readers with a background in machine learning and natural language processing.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-organized and presents an interesting problem in the field of natural language processing. The authors' approach to solving this problem is clearly explained and the results are promising, making the paper an enjoyable read for those interested in text normalization and abbreviation expansion.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
