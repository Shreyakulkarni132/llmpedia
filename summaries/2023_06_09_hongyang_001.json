{"Published": "2023-06-09", "Title": "FinGPT: Open-Source Financial Large Language Models", "Authors": "Hongyang Yang, Xiao-Yang Liu, Christina Dan Wang", "Summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential of revolutionizing natural language processing tasks in diverse domains, sparking great interest in finance. Accessing high-quality financial data is the first challenge for financial LLMs (FinLLMs). While proprietary models like BloombergGPT have taken advantage of their unique data accumulation, such privileged access calls for an open-source alternative to democratize Internet-scale financial data.   In this paper, we present an open-source large language model, FinGPT, for the finance sector. Unlike proprietary models, FinGPT takes a data-centric approach, providing researchers and practitioners with accessible and transparent resources to develop their FinLLMs. We highlight the importance of an automatic data curation pipeline and the lightweight low-rank adaptation technique in building FinGPT. Furthermore, we showcase several potential applications as stepping stones for users, such as robo-advising, algorithmic trading, and low-code development. Through collaborative efforts within the open-source AI4Finance community, FinGPT aims to stimulate innovation, democratize FinLLMs, and unlock new opportunities in open finance.

Its open-source nature and data-centric approach make it a transparent and accessible tool for developing FinLLMs. The automatic data curation pipeline simplifies the process of data acquisition, cleaning, and preprocessing, while the lightweight low-rank adaptation technique aids in model building. Potential applications include robo-advising, algorithmic trading, and low-code development.", "example": "For instance, a practitioner could use FinGPT to develop a robo-advisor application. The automatic data curation pipeline would handle data acquisition and preprocessing, while the low-rank adaptation technique would assist in model training. The resulting application could provide automated financial advice based on the analysis of large volumes of financial data."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The novelty of the paper lies in the introduction of FinGPT, an open-source large language model specifically designed for the finance sector. While the concept of applying LLMs to finance is not new, the authors' emphasis on data-centric approach and the introduction of an automatic data curation pipeline and a lightweight low-rank adaptation technique add a unique perspective to the field.", "novelty_score": 2, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, discussing the design and implementation of FinGPT, including the automatic data curation pipeline and the lightweight low-rank adaptation technique. However, it does not delve into complex mathematical theories or algorithms, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents an interesting application of LLMs in the finance sector. The introduction of FinGPT and its potential applications make for an engaging read. However, the technical details of the model's implementation might be challenging for readers without a background in the field.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
