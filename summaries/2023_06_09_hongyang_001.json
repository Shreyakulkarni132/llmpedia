{"Published": "2023-06-09", "Title": "FinGPT: Open-Source Financial Large Language Models", "Authors": "Hongyang Yang, Xiao-Yang Liu, Christina Dan Wang", "Summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential of revolutionizing natural language processing tasks in diverse domains, sparking great interest in finance. Accessing high-quality financial data is the first challenge for financial LLMs (FinLLMs). While proprietary models like BloombergGPT have taken advantage of their unique data accumulation, such privileged access calls for an open-source alternative to democratize Internet-scale financial data.   In this paper, we present an open-source large language model, FinGPT, for the finance sector. Unlike proprietary models, FinGPT takes a data-centric approach, providing researchers and practitioners with accessible and transparent resources to develop their FinLLMs. We highlight the importance of an automatic data curation pipeline and the lightweight low-rank adaptation technique in building FinGPT. Furthermore, we showcase several potential applications as stepping stones for users, such as robo-advising, algorithmic trading, and low-code development. Through collaborative efforts within the open-source AI4Finance community, FinGPT aims to stimulate innovation, democratize FinLLMs, and unlock new opportunities in open finance.

It provides an open-source alternative to proprietary models, making financial data and FinLLMs more accessible and transparent. The model also showcases potential applications such as robo-advising, algorithmic trading, and low-code development, providing stepping stones for users to develop their own applications.", "example": "For instance, a practitioner could use FinGPT to develop a robo-advising application. They would first use the automatic data curation pipeline to gather and preprocess relevant financial data. Then, they would use the lightweight low-rank adaptation technique to train the model. Finally, they would use the trained model to provide financial advice to users."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "FinGPT is a novel contribution to the field of financial LLMs. It provides an open-source alternative to proprietary models, making financial data and FinLLMs more accessible and transparent. The model's data-centric approach and emphasis on automatic data curation and lightweight low-rank adaptation are unique features that set it apart from existing models.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it discusses the process of building FinGPT, including data acquisition, cleaning, and preprocessing, as well as the use of a lightweight low-rank adaptation technique. However, it does not delve into complex mathematical theories or algorithms, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and organized, presenting a novel and intriguing contribution to the field of financial LLMs. It provides practical insights and potential applications, making it an enjoyable read for both researchers and practitioners.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
