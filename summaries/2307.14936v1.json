New and powerful models are released on a weekly basis, demonstrating remarkable performance on the code generation task. Various approaches have been proposed to boost the code generation performance of pre-trained Code LLMs, such as supervised fine-tuning, instruction tuning, reinforcement learning, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel RRTF (Rank Responses to align Test&Teacher Feedback) framework, which can effectively and efficiently boost pre-trained large language models for code generation. Under this framework, we present PanGu-Coder2, which achieves 62.20% pass@1 on the OpenAI HumanEval benchmark. Furthermore, through an extensive evaluation on CoderEval and LeetCode benchmarks, we show that PanGu-Coder2 consistently outperforms all previous Code LLMs.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Introduction of RRTF framework and PanGu-Coder2 for enhanced code generation", "description": "The paper introduces a novel framework, RRTF (Rank Responses to align Test&Teacher Feedback), designed to boost the performance of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation.
