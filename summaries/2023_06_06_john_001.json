{"Published": "2023-06-06", "Title": "A Watermark for Large Language Models", "Authors": "John Kirchenbauer, Jonas Geiping, Yuxin Wen, Jonathan Katz, Ian Miers, Tom Goldstein", "Summary": "Potential harms of large language models can be mitigated by watermarking model output, i.e., embedding signals into generated text that are invisible to humans but algorithmically detectable from a short span of tokens. We propose a watermarking framework for proprietary language models. The watermark can be embedded with negligible impact on text quality, and can be detected using an efficient open-source algorithm without access to the language model API or parameters. The watermark works by selecting a randomized set of \"green\" tokens before a word is generated, and then softly promoting use of green tokens during sampling. We propose a statistical test for detecting the watermark with interpretable p-values, and derive an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the sensitivity of the watermark. We test the watermark using a multi-billion parameter model from the Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT) family, and discuss robustness and security.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Watermarking Framework for Large Language Models to Mitigate Potential Harms", "description": "The paper introduces a watermarking framework for large language models (LLMs) to mitigate potential harms.

By embedding a watermark in the model's output, it becomes possible to detect and audit machine-generated text, which can help mitigate potential harms such as the creation of fake news or the use of AI systems for cheating. The watermarking process has a negligible impact on text quality and can be detected using an efficient open-source algorithm.", "example": "For instance, an LLM practitioner could use the watermarking framework to embed a watermark in the output of a chatbot. If this chatbot's output is later found on a social media platform, the watermark can be detected, confirming that the text was machine-generated and not written by a human."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to mitigating the potential harms of LLMs by introducing a watermarking framework. This framework allows for the detection and auditing of machine-generated text, a feature not commonly found in existing LLMs.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it introduces a new watermarking framework and discusses its implementation in detail. It also proposes a statistical test for detecting the watermark and an information-theoretic framework for analyzing its sensitivity. However, the concepts are explained clearly, making it accessible to readers with a basic understanding of LLMs.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents an interesting solution to a significant problem in the field of LLMs. The clear explanation of the watermarking framework and its potential applications make it an engaging read.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
