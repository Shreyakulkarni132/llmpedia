{"Published": "2023-05-17", "Title": "Reprompting: Automated Chain-of-Thought Prompt Inference Through Gibbs Sampling", "Authors": "Weijia Xu, Andrzej Banburski-Fahey, Nebojsa Jojic", "Summary": "We introduce Reprompting, an iterative sampling algorithm that searches for the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) recipes for a given task without human intervention. Through Gibbs sampling, we infer CoT recipes that work consistently well for a set of training samples. Our method iteratively samples new recipes using previously sampled solutions as parent prompts to solve other training problems. On five Big-Bench Hard tasks that require multi-step reasoning, Reprompting achieves consistently better performance than the zero-shot, few-shot, and human-written CoT baselines. Reprompting can also facilitate transfer of knowledge from a stronger model to a weaker model leading to substantially improved performance of the weaker model. Overall, Reprompting brings up to +17 point improvements over the previous state-of-the-art method that uses human-written CoT prompts.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Introduction of 'Reprompting', an automated CoT prompt discovery algorithm", "description": "The paper introduces 'Reprompting', an iterative sampling algorithm that automates the discovery of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts for a given task, eliminating the need for human intervention.

This could streamline the process of task learning for LLMs, making them more efficient and versatile.
