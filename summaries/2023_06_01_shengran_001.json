{"Published": "2023-06-01", "Title": "Thought Cloning: Learning to Think while Acting by Imitating Human Thinking", "Authors": "Shengran Hu, Jeff Clune", "Summary": "Language is often considered a key aspect of human thinking, providing us with exceptional abilities to generalize, explore, plan, replan, and adapt to new situations. However, Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are far from human-level performance in any of these abilities. We hypothesize one reason for such cognitive deficiencies is that they lack the benefits of thinking in language and that we can improve AI agents by training them to think like humans do. We introduce a novel Imitation Learning framework, Thought Cloning, where the idea is to not just clone the behaviors of human demonstrators, but also the thoughts humans have as they perform these behaviors. While we expect Thought Cloning to truly shine at scale on internet-sized datasets of humans thinking out loud while acting (e.g. online videos with transcripts), here we conduct experiments in a domain where the thinking and action data are synthetically generated. Results reveal that Thought Cloning learns much faster than Behavioral Cloning and its performance advantage grows the further out of distribution test tasks are, highlighting its ability to better handle novel situations. Thought Cloning also provides important benefits for AI Safety and Interpretability, and makes it easier to debug and improve AI. Because we can observe the agent's thoughts, we can (1) more easily diagnose why things are going wrong, making it easier to fix the problem, (2) steer the agent by correcting its thinking, or (3) prevent it from doing unsafe things it plans to do. Overall, by training agents how to think as well as behave, Thought Cloning creates safer, more powerful agents.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Thought Cloning: A Novel Framework for Imitating Human Thinking in AI Agents", "description": "The paper introduces Thought Cloning, a novel Imitation Learning framework that aims to train AI agents to not only mimic human behaviors but also the thoughts that humans have while performing these behaviors.

This approach also offers benefits in terms of AI Safety and Interpretability. By observing the agent's thoughts, it becomes easier to diagnose why things are going wrong and fix the problem, steer the agent by correcting its thinking, or prevent it from doing unsafe things it plans to do. This could be particularly useful in applications where safety and interpretability are paramount, such as autonomous driving or medical diagnosis.", "example": "For instance, in an autonomous driving scenario, if an AI agent thinks 'My goal is to take my passenger to the store as fast as possible so I will run through this red light without stopping', one could intervene to stop that behavior ahead of time, thus enhancing safety."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of the Thought Cloning framework represents a significant advancement in the field of AI. While there has been some discussion on the benefits of agents that can understand language, there has been relatively little discussion in AI, especially in Reinforcement Learning (RL), regarding the many benefits of agents that think in language. This work fills this gap and provides a promising method for training AI agents to think like humans.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, discussing the details of the Thought Cloning framework and the experiments conducted to validate it. However, the authors do a good job of explaining the concepts in a clear and understandable manner, making it accessible to readers with a basic understanding of AI and machine learning.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and organized, presenting a novel and intriguing contribution to the field of AI. The authors' clear explanation of the Thought Cloning framework and its benefits, as well as the detailed presentation of the experimental results, make it an enjoyable read.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
