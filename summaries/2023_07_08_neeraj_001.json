{"Published": "2023-07-08", "Title": "A Stitch in Time Saves Nine: Detecting and Mitigating Hallucinations of LLMs by Validating Low-Confidence Generation", "Authors": "Neeraj Varshney, Wenlin Yao, Hongming Zhang, Jianshu Chen, Dong Yu", "Summary": "Recently developed large language models have achieved remarkable success in generating fluent and coherent text. However, these models often tend to 'hallucinate' which critically hampers their reliability. In this work, we address this crucial problem and propose an approach that actively detects and mitigates hallucinations during the generation process. Specifically, we first identify the candidates of potential hallucination leveraging the model's logit output values, check their correctness through a validation procedure, mitigate the detected hallucinations, and then continue with the generation process. Through extensive experiments with the 'article generation task', we first demonstrate the individual efficacy of our detection and mitigation techniques. Specifically, the detection technique achieves a recall of 88% and the mitigation technique successfully mitigates 57.6% of the correctly detected hallucinations. Importantly, our mitigation technique does not introduce new hallucinations even in the case of incorrectly detected hallucinations, i.e., false positives. Then, we show that the proposed active detection and mitigation approach successfully reduces the hallucinations of the GPT-3 model from 47.5% to 14.5% on average. In summary, our work contributes to improving the reliability and trustworthiness of large language models, a crucial step en route to enabling their widespread adoption in real-world applications.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Active detection and mitigation of hallucinations in Large Language Models", "description": "The paper presents a novel approach to actively detect and mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) during the text generation process. Hallucinations refer to the generation of text that, while syntactically sound and fluent, is factually incorrect or nonsensical. The authors propose a method that identifies potential hallucinations using the model's logit output values, validates their correctness, and mitigates any detected hallucinations before continuing with the generation process. This approach significantly reduces the hallucination rate in LLMs, improving their reliability and trustworthiness."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Active hallucination detection and mitigation enhances LLM reliability", "description": "The proposed method of actively detecting and mitigating hallucinations can significantly improve the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications. By identifying potential hallucinations using the model's logit output values and validating their correctness, the approach can prevent the propagation of hallucinations in the generated text. This can be particularly useful in applications where the accuracy of the generated text is critical, such as news generation, automated report writing, or any other application where misinformation could have serious consequences.", "example": "For instance, in an automated news generation application, the proposed method could be used to actively monitor the text being generated by the LLM. If a potential hallucination is detected, it could be validated and mitigated before the text is finalized, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the generated news article."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to actively detect and mitigate hallucinations in LLMs during the text generation process.
