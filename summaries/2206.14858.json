Nevertheless, state-of-the-art models have generally struggled with tasks that require quantitative reasoning, such as solving mathematics, science, and engineering problems at the college level. To help close this gap, we introduce Minerva, a large language model pretrained on general natural language data and further trained on technical content. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on technical benchmarks without the use of external tools. We also evaluate our model on over two hundred undergraduate-level problems in physics, biology, chemistry, economics, and other sciences that require quantitative reasoning, and find that the model can correctly answer nearly a third of them.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Minerva: A Large Language Model Trained for Quantitative Reasoning", "description": "The paper introduces Minerva, a large language model that has been pretrained on general natural language data and further trained on technical content. Unlike previous models, Minerva is designed to tackle tasks that require quantitative reasoning, such as solving mathematics, science, and engineering problems at the college level. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on technical benchmarks without the use of external tools. It has been evaluated on over two hundred undergraduate-level problems in various sciences and can correctly answer nearly a third of them."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Minerva offers a new approach to quantitative reasoning in LLMs", "description": "Minerva's ability to handle quantitative reasoning tasks opens up new possibilities for LLM applications. It can be used to develop intelligent tutoring systems, automated problem solvers, or decision support systems in technical fields. The model's performance on technical benchmarks also suggests that it could be used to improve the efficiency of existing workflows that involve quantitative reasoning.", "example": "For instance, an LLM practitioner could use Minerva to develop an intelligent tutoring system for college-level mathematics. The system could use Minerva to generate solutions to problems, provide step-by-step explanations, and answer students' questions."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to training large language models for quantitative reasoning tasks. While previous models have struggled with these tasks, Minerva achieves state-of-the-art performance on technical benchmarks. This represents a significant advancement in the field of large language models.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it discusses the training of a large language model for quantitative reasoning tasks.
