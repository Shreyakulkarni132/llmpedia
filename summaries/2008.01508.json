{"Published": "2020-12-24", "Title": "Explanation of Reinforcement Learning Model in Dynamic Multi-Agent System", "Authors": "Xinzhi Wang, Huao Li, Hui Zhang, Michael Lewis, Katia Sycara", "Summary": "Recently, there has been increasing interest in transparency and interpretability in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems. Verbal explanations, as the most natural way of communication in our daily life, deserve more attention, since they allow users to gain a better understanding of the system which ultimately could lead to a high level of trust and smooth collaboration. This paper reports a novel work in generating verbal explanations for DRL behaviors agent. A rule-based model is designed to construct explanations using a series of rules which are predefined with prior knowledge. A learning model is then proposed to expand the implicit logic of generating verbal explanation to general situations by employing rule-based explanations as training data. The learning model is shown to have better flexibility and generalizability than the static rule-based model. The performance of both models is evaluated quantitatively through objective metrics. The results show that verbal explanation generated by both models improve subjective satisfaction of users towards the interpretability of DRL systems. Additionally, seven variants of the learning model are designed to illustrate the contribution of input channels, attention mechanism, and proposed encoder in improving the quality of verbal explanation.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Novel Approach to Generate Verbal Explanations for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Behaviors", "description": "The paper introduces a novel approach to generate verbal explanations for the behaviors of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents. The authors propose a two-step model: a rule-based model and a learning model. The rule-based model constructs explanations using predefined rules based on prior knowledge. The learning model then generalizes this rule-based explanation generation to broader situations, using the rule-based explanations as training data. The learning model is shown to have better flexibility and generalizability than the static rule-based model. The authors also design seven variants of the learning model to illustrate the contribution of input channels, attention mechanism, and proposed encoder in improving the quality of verbal explanation."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Verbal Explanation Models Enhance Transparency and Interpretability of DRL Systems", "description": "The proposed models for generating verbal explanations can enhance the transparency and interpretability of DRL systems, leading to increased user trust and smoother collaboration. The learning model, in particular, offers flexibility and generalizability, making it a valuable tool for AI practitioners working with DRL systems. The seven variants of the learning model provide insights into the roles of different components in improving explanation quality. For instance, an LLM practitioner could use these models to generate understandable explanations for the actions of a DRL agent in a game, thereby improving user experience and trust.", "example": "For example, given a DRL agent playing a game, the rule-based model could generate an explanation like 'The agent moved left because the enemy was on the right.' The learning model could then generalize this rule to generate explanations for similar situations, such as 'The agent moved up because the enemy was below.'"}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to generating verbal explanations for DRL behaviors, which is a significant contribution to the field of interpretability in DRL. The two-step model, consisting of a rule-based model and a learning model, is a unique approach that enhances the flexibility and generalizability of explanation generation.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it delves into the details of the proposed models and their variants. It requires a good understanding of DRL and explanation generation techniques.
