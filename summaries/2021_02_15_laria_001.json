{"Published": "2021-02-15", "Title": "Prompt Programming for Large Language Models: Beyond the Few-Shot Paradigm", "Authors": "Laria Reynolds, Kyle McDonell", "Summary": "Prevailing methods for mapping large generative language models to supervised tasks may fail to sufficiently probe models' novel capabilities. Using GPT-3 as a case study, we show that 0-shot prompts can significantly outperform few-shot prompts. We suggest that the function of few-shot examples in these cases is better described as locating an already learned task rather than meta-learning. This analysis motivates rethinking the role of prompts in controlling and evaluating powerful language models. In this work, we discuss methods of prompt programming, emphasizing the usefulness of considering prompts through the lens of natural language. We explore techniques for exploiting the capacity of narratives and cultural anchors to encode nuanced intentions and techniques for encouraging deconstruction of a problem into components before producing a verdict. Informed by this more encompassing theory of prompt programming, we also introduce the idea of a metaprompt that seeds the model to generate its own natural language prompts for a range of tasks. Finally, we discuss how these more general methods of interacting with language models can be incorporated into existing and future benchmarks and practical applications.", "main_contribution": "The paper challenges the prevailing notion of few-shot learning in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, arguing that the function of few-shot examples is more about locating an already learned task rather than facilitating meta-learning. The authors introduce the concept of '0-shot prompts', which they demonstrate can outperform few-shot prompts. They also propose a new approach to prompt programming, emphasizing the importance of natural language and introducing the concept of a 'metaprompt' that seeds the model to generate its own prompts.", "takeaways": "The paper's findings suggest that the current methods of controlling LLMs to perform specific tasks can be significantly improved. The introduction of 0-shot prompts and metaprompts could lead to more effective and nuanced interactions with LLMs. The emphasis on natural language in prompt programming could also lead to more intuitive and human-like responses from these models.", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel perspective on the role of prompts in controlling and evaluating LLMs, challenging the prevailing few-shot learning paradigm. The introduction of 0-shot prompts and metaprompts represents a significant departure from existing methods.", "novelty_score": 3, "category": "PROMPTING", "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, discussing the intricacies of prompt programming and the underlying mechanisms of LLMs. However, it remains accessible to those with a background in computer science or AI research.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents a novel and interesting perspective on the role of prompts in LLMs. However, the technical nature of the content may make it less enjoyable for those without a background in the field.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
