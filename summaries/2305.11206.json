We measure the relative importance of these two stages by training LIMA, a 65B parameter LLaMa language model fine-tuned with the standard supervised loss on only 1,000 carefully curated prompts and responses, without any reinforcement learning or human preference modeling. LIMA demonstrates remarkably strong performance, learning to follow specific response formats from only a handful of examples in the training data, including complex queries that range from planning trip itineraries to speculating about alternate history. Moreover, the model tends to generalize well to unseen tasks that did not appear in the training data. In a controlled human study, responses from LIMA are either equivalent or strictly preferred to GPT-4 in 43% of cases; this statistic is as high as 58% when compared to Bard and 65% versus DaVinci003, which was trained with human feedback. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that almost all knowledge in large language models is learned during pretraining, and only limited instruction tuning data is necessary to teach models to produce high quality output.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "LIMA: A Large Language Model Fine-Tuned on Minimal Data", "description": "The paper introduces LIMA, a 65B parameter language model that is fine-tuned on only 1,000 carefully curated prompts and responses.

This could potentially reduce the computational resources required for fine-tuning and make the process more efficient. The study also emphasizes the importance of the pretraining stage in learning general-purpose representations. Practitioners can leverage these insights to optimize their fine-tuning processes.", "example": "For instance, instead of using a large dataset for fine-tuning, practitioners can curate a smaller set of high-quality prompts and responses. The model can then be fine-tuned on this data, potentially saving computational resources and time."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to fine-tuning large language models using a minimal amount of data.
