{"Published": "2023-05-24", "Title": "The Larger They Are, the Harder They Fail: Language Models do not Recognize Identifier Swaps in Python", "Authors": "Antonio Valerio Miceli-Barone, Fazl Barez, Ioannis Konstas, Shay B. Cohen", "Summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have successfully been applied to code generation tasks, raising the question of how well these models understand programming. Typical programming languages have invariances and equivariances in their semantics that human programmers intuitively understand and exploit, such as the (near) invariance to the renaming of identifiers. We show that LLMs not only fail to properly generate correct Python code when default function names are swapped, but some of them even become more confident in their incorrect predictions as the model size increases, an instance of the recently discovered phenomenon of Inverse Scaling, which runs contrary to the commonly observed trend of increasing prediction quality with increasing model size. Our findings indicate that, despite their astonishing typical-case performance, LLMs still lack a deep, abstract understanding of the content they manipulate, making them unsuitable for tasks that statistically deviate from their training data, and that mere scaling is not enough to achieve such capability.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "LLMs Fail to Recognize Identifier Swaps in Python", "description": "The paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate correct Python code when default function names are swapped.

This highlights the limitations of LLMs in handling tasks that deviate from their training data. For practitioners, this implies that while LLMs can be powerful tools for code generation, they may not always produce accurate results in less common or unconventional scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial to consider these limitations when using LLMs for code generation tasks.", "example": "For instance, if you have a Python code where the default function names 'len' and 'print' are swapped (i.e., len, print = print, len), an LLM would struggle to generate the correct code for a function that uses these swapped identifiers. This is because the LLM is trained on common code scenarios where 'len' and 'print' have their usual meanings."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel type of inverse scaling task involving Python code generation under a redefinition of default identifiers. This is a unique contribution as it not only has practical implications but also broader scientific implications, showing that LLMs fail to reason about the deep, abstract semantic structure of programming languages. These flaws are not ameliorated, but may even be worsened, by increasing model size.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical as it delves into the specifics of how LLMs handle Python code generation tasks, particularly when default function names are swapped. It requires a basic understanding of LLMs and Python programming. However, the concepts are explained clearly, making it accessible to readers with a basic background in these areas.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents an interesting investigation into the limitations of LLMs in handling uncommon code scenarios. The findings are surprising and challenge the commonly held belief that larger LLMs always produce better results. This makes the paper an engaging read for those interested in the behavior and limitations of LLMs.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
