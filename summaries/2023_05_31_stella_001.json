How do these patterns change as models scale? To answer these questions, we introduce \\textit{Pythia}, a suite of 16 LLMs all trained on public data seen in the exact same order and ranging in size from 70M to 12B parameters. We provide public access to 154 checkpoints for each one of the 16 models, alongside tools to download and reconstruct their exact training dataloaders for further study. We intend \\textit{Pythia} to facilitate research in many areas, and we present several case studies including novel results in memorization, term frequency effects on few-shot performance, and reducing gender bias. We demonstrate that this highly controlled setup can be used to yield novel insights toward LLMs and their training dynamics. Trained models, analysis code, training code, and training data can be found at \\url{https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia}.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Pythia: A Suite for Analyzing Large Language Models Across Training and Scaling", "description": "The paper introduces Pythia, a suite of 16 Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on public data in the same order, with sizes ranging from 70M to 12B parameters.

The suite's public access to numerous checkpoints and training dataloaders can help researchers gain novel insights into LLMs and their training dynamics. This can potentially lead to the development of more efficient training methods and improved model performance.", "example": "For instance, a researcher can use Pythia to study how an LLM's performance on a specific task evolves over the course of training. By analyzing the model's performance at different checkpoints, the researcher can identify the stages of training where the model learns the most about the task and adjust the training process accordingly."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of Pythia, a suite of 16 LLMs trained on the same data in the same order, is a novel contribution to the field.
