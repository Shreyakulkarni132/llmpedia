However, these approaches are fundamentally bounded by the correctness of explanations, which themselves are often noisy and inconsistent. In this work, we develop Maieutic Prompting, which infers a correct answer to a question even from the noisy and inconsistent generations of LM. Maieutic Prompting induces a tree of explanations abductively (e.g. X is true, because ...) and recursively, then frames the inference as a satisfiability problem over these explanations and their logical relations. We test Maieutic Prompting for true/false QA on three challenging benchmarks that require complex commonsense reasoning. Maieutic Prompting achieves up to 20% better accuracy than state-of-the-art prompting methods, and as a fully unsupervised approach, performs competitively with supervised models. We also show that Maieutic Prompting improves robustness in inference while providing interpretable rationales.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Maieutic Prompting: A novel method for logically consistent reasoning in LLMs", "description": "The paper introduces Maieutic Prompting, a new method that improves the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This method works by inducing a tree of explanations from the LLM's output, which are often noisy and inconsistent, and then framing the inference as a satisfiability problem over these explanations and their logical relations. The approach is unsupervised and has been shown to improve accuracy by up to 20% over state-of-the-art prompting methods on true/false question-answering tasks that require complex commonsense reasoning. Additionally, Maieutic Prompting enhances the robustness of inference and provides interpretable rationales."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Maieutic Prompting improves LLM reasoning and provides interpretable rationales", "description": "Maieutic Prompting offers a promising approach to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in tasks that require complex commonsense reasoning. It can be used to enhance the performance of LLMs in question-answering tasks, especially those that require a true/false response. The method also provides interpretable rationales, which can be beneficial in applications where understanding the reasoning process of the model is important. However, the implementation of Maieutic Prompting might require a solid understanding of logical reasoning and satisfiability problems.", "example": "For instance, in a customer service chatbot application, Maieutic Prompting can be used to improve the bot's ability to answer complex customer queries. The bot can generate a tree of explanations for its responses, which can then be used to ensure the logical consistency of its answers. This can lead to more accurate and reliable responses, improving the overall customer experience."}, "category": "PROMPTING", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of Maieutic Prompting represents a significant advancement in the field of LLM prompting.
