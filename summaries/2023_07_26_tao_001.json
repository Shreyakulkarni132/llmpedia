Generalist biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale can potentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery to care delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curate MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses 14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and summarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AI system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and genomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks, often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples of zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer learning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologist evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe encouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246 retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference for Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is needed to validate these models in real-world use cases, our results represent a milestone towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Development of a Generalist Biomedical AI System and Benchmark", "description": "The paper presents a significant stride towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.

The model's ability to encode and interpret diverse biomedical data, including clinical language, imaging, and genomics, can be leveraged to build systems that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. This could lead to more efficient and comprehensive AI systems in healthcare. For instance, a system could be built that not only interprets mammograms but also incorporates relevant patient health records and medical literature to refine its performance.", "example": "Consider a system that is tasked with interpreting mammograms. With Med-PaLM M, the system could also incorporate relevant information such as patient health records (e.g., breast cancer gene screening status), other modalities such as MRI, or published medical literature that might help contextualize, refine, and improve performance. This could lead to more accurate and comprehensive interpretations."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to developing generalist biomedical AI systems.
