As LLMs increasingly power conversational agents, the synthesized personality embedded in these models by virtue of their training on large amounts of human-generated data draws attention. Since personality is an important factor determining the effectiveness of communication, we present a comprehensive method for administering validated psychometric tests and quantifying, analyzing, and shaping personality traits exhibited in text generated from widely-used LLMs. We find that: 1) personality simulated in the outputs of some LLMs (under specific prompting configurations) is reliable and valid; 2) evidence of reliability and validity of LLM-simulated personality is stronger for larger and instruction fine-tuned models; and 3) personality in LLM outputs can be shaped along desired dimensions to mimic specific personality profiles. We also discuss potential applications and ethical implications of our measurement and shaping framework, especially regarding responsible use of LLMs.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Quantifying and shaping personality traits in LLMs", "description": "This paper presents a comprehensive method for administering validated psychometric tests to quantify, analyze, and shape personality traits exhibited in text generated from widely-used Large Language Models (LLMs).

By understanding the personality traits exhibited by an LLM, practitioners can better tailor the model's responses to suit the context and audience. Furthermore, the ability to shape these traits allows for the creation of LLMs that can mimic specific personality profiles, potentially leading to more engaging and relatable conversational agents.", "example": "For instance, an LLM could be fine-tuned to exhibit a more empathetic personality for applications in mental health support, or a more authoritative personality for applications in legal advice. This could be achieved by adjusting the prompting configurations and fine-tuning the model based on the methods presented in this paper."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to understanding and shaping the personality traits of LLMs. While previous work has explored the behavior of LLMs, the focus on personality traits and the comprehensive method for quantifying and shaping these traits is a unique contribution.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it involves the application of psychometric tests to LLMs and the analysis of the resulting data. However, the concepts are explained clearly and should be accessible to readers with a basic understanding of LLMs and psychometrics.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and presents an interesting and novel approach to understanding and shaping the behavior of LLMs. The potential applications and ethical implications discussed also make for engaging reading.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
