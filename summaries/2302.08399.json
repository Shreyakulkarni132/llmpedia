{"Published": "2023-03-14", "Title": "Large Language Models Fail on Trivial Alterations to Theory-of-Mind Tasks", "Authors": "Tomer Ullman", "Summary": "Intuitive psychology is a pillar of common-sense reasoning. The replication of this reasoning in machine intelligence is an important stepping-stone on the way to human-like artificial intelligence. Several recent tasks and benchmarks for examining this reasoning in Large-Large Models have focused in particular on belief attribution in Theory-of-Mind tasks. These tasks have shown both successes and failures. We consider in particular a recent purported success case, and show that small variations that maintain the principles of ToM turn the results on their head. We argue that in general, the zero-hypothesis for model evaluation in intuitive psychology should be skeptical, and that outlying failure cases should outweigh average success rates. We also consider what possible future successes on Theory-of-Mind tasks by more powerful LLMs would mean for ToM tasks with people.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "LLMs Fail on Trivial Alterations to Theory-of-Mind Tasks", "description": "This paper critically examines the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Theory-of-Mind (ToM) tasks, which are crucial for replicating intuitive psychology in machine intelligence. The author argues that while LLMs have shown some success in these tasks, they fail when presented with small variations that maintain the principles of ToM. The paper suggests that the zero-hypothesis for model evaluation in intuitive psychology should be skeptical, and that outlying failure cases should outweigh average success rates."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "LLMs need to improve on handling variations in Theory-of-Mind tasks", "description": "The paper highlights the limitations of LLMs in handling variations in Theory-of-Mind tasks, which is crucial for developing human-like AI. This insight can guide LLM practitioners to focus on improving the model's ability to handle variations in tasks, rather than just achieving high average success rates. The paper also emphasizes the importance of being skeptical when evaluating models in intuitive psychology, which can help in identifying and addressing the model's weaknesses.", "example": "For instance, if an LLM performs well on a ToM task, it should also be tested on variations of the same task to ensure its robustness. If it fails on the variations, then the model needs to be improved to handle such variations."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper provides a critical perspective on the evaluation of LLMs in Theory-of-Mind tasks, which is a significant contribution to the field. However, the idea of testing models on variations of tasks and being skeptical in model evaluation is not entirely new.", "novelty_score": 2, "technical_analysis": "The paper discusses the performance of LLMs on Theory-of-Mind tasks and their limitations, which is a topic that requires some understanding of AI and machine learning. However, it does not delve into complex mathematical theories or algorithms, making it accessible to a wider audience.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper provides a critical perspective on the evaluation of LLMs, which is thought-provoking and can lead to meaningful discussions. However, the lack of practical examples and technical details might make it less enjoyable for some readers.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
