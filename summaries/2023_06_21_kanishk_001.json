{"Published": "2023-06-21", "Title": "Understanding Social Reasoning in Language Models with Language Models", "Authors": "Kanishk Gandhi, Jan-Philipp Fr\u00e4nken, Tobias Gerstenberg, Noah D. Goodman", "Summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our everyday lives, understanding their ability to comprehend human mental states becomes critical for ensuring effective interactions. However, despite the recent attempts to assess the Theory-of-Mind (ToM) reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the degree to which these models can align with human ToM remains a nuanced topic of exploration. This is primarily due to two distinct challenges: (1) the presence of inconsistent results from previous evaluations, and (2) concerns surrounding the validity of existing evaluation methodologies. To address these challenges, we present a novel framework for procedurally generating evaluations with LLMs by populating causal templates. Using our framework, we create a new social reasoning benchmark (BigToM) for LLMs which consists of 25 controls and 5,000 model-written evaluations. We find that human participants rate the quality of our benchmark higher than previous crowd-sourced evaluations and comparable to expert-written evaluations. Using BigToM, we evaluate the social reasoning capabilities of a variety of LLMs and compare model performances with human performance. Our results suggest that GPT4 has ToM capabilities that mirror human inference patterns, though less reliable, while other LLMs struggle.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "A Novel Framework for Evaluating Social Reasoning in Large Language Models", "description": "The paper presents a novel framework for evaluating the social reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically their ability to comprehend human mental states, a concept known as Theory-of-Mind (ToM).

The framework's procedural generation of evaluations using causal templates allows for a more nuanced exploration of LLMs' ability to comprehend human mental states. The authors' creation of the BigToM benchmark provides a valuable resource for future research and development in the field. The findings suggest that while GPT4 shows promising capabilities in mirroring human inference patterns, there is still room for improvement in the reliability of these models.", "example": "For instance, in a customer service chatbot application, understanding the customer's mental state is crucial for effective interaction. Using the BigToM benchmark, developers can evaluate and improve the chatbot's ability to comprehend and respond to the customer's mental state, leading to more effective and human-like interactions."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper introduces a novel framework for evaluating the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs, addressing the challenges in existing methodologies.
