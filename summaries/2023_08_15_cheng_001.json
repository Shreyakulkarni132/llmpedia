	"Summary": "Personalized text generation is an emerging research area that has attracted much attention in recent years. Most studies in this direction focus on a particular domain by designing bespoke features or models. In this work, we propose a general approach for personalized text generation using large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the practice of writing education, we develop a multistage and multitask framework to teach LLMs for personalized generation. In writing instruction, the task of writing from sources is often decomposed into multiple steps that involve finding, evaluating, summarizing, synthesizing, and integrating information. Analogously, our approach to personalized text generation consists of multiple stages: retrieval, ranking, summarization, synthesis, and generation. In addition, we introduce a multitask setting that helps the model improve its generation ability further, which is inspired by the observation in education that a student's reading proficiency and writing ability are often correlated. We evaluate our approach on three public datasets, each of which covers a different and representative domain. Our results show significant improvements over a variety of baselines.",

		"description": "The paper presents a novel approach to personalized text generation using large language models (LLMs), inspired by the practice of writing education. The authors propose a multistage and multitask framework that mimics the process of writing from sources, involving steps such as retrieval, ranking, summarization, synthesis, and generation. The framework also introduces a multitask setting that correlates a model's reading proficiency with its writing ability, aiming to improve the model's generation capability. The approach is evaluated on three public datasets, each representing a different domain, and shows significant improvements over various baselines."

		"headline": "Multistage and Multitask Framework Enhances Personalized Text Generation",
		"description": "The proposed multistage and multitask framework can be used to enhance the performance of LLMs in personalized text generation tasks. The framework's stages, inspired by the practice of writing education, guide the model to retrieve, rank, summarize, synthesize, and generate text, providing a structured approach to text generation. The multitask setting, which correlates reading proficiency with writing ability, can further improve the model's generation capability. This approach can be applied to various domains, as demonstrated by the evaluation on three public datasets.",
		"example": "For instance, if a user is writing a document on a specific topic, the LLM can retrieve relevant information from the user's past documents, rank the retrieved results based on their relevance, summarize the ranked results, synthesize key elements, and finally generate the new document. This process can be further enhanced by introducing an auxiliary task that charges the model to attribute the authorship of a given text, improving the model's reading ability and in turn its writing ability."
