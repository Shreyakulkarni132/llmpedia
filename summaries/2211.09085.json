The explosive growth in scientific literature and data has made it ever harder to discover useful insights in a large mass of information. Today scientific knowledge is accessed through search engines, but they are unable to organize scientific knowledge alone. In this paper we introduce Galactica: a large language model that can store, combine and reason about scientific knowledge. We train on a large scientific corpus of papers, reference material, knowledge bases and many other sources. We outperform existing models on a range of scientific tasks. On technical knowledge probes such as LaTeX equations, Galactica outperforms the latest GPT-3 by 68.2% versus 49.0%. Galactica also performs well on reasoning, outperforming Chinchilla on mathematical MMLU by 41.3% to 35.7%, and PaLM 540B on MATH with a score of 20.4% versus 8.8%. It also sets a new state-of-the-art on downstream tasks such as PubMedQA and MedMCQA dev of 77.6% and 52.9%. And despite not being trained on a general corpus, Galactica outperforms BLOOM and OPT-175B on BIG-bench. We believe these results demonstrate the potential for language models as a new interface for science. We open source the model for the benefit of the scientific community.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Galactica: A Large Language Model Trained for Scientific Knowledge Storage and Reasoning", "description": "The paper introduces Galactica, a large language model (LLM) specifically trained to store, combine, and reason about scientific knowledge. Unlike traditional search engines, Galactica is designed to organize and synthesize scientific knowledge, potentially uncovering hidden connections between different research areas. The model is trained on a large corpus of scientific papers, reference materials, knowledge bases, and other sources. It outperforms existing models on a range of scientific tasks, including technical knowledge probes and reasoning tasks, and sets a new state-of-the-art on downstream tasks such as PubMedQA and MedMCQA dev."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Galactica offers a new approach to managing scientific knowledge overload", "description": "Galactica's ability to store, combine, and reason about scientific knowledge presents a new way to manage the information overload in the scientific community. It can potentially uncover hidden connections between different research areas, synthesize knowledge, and organize different modalities. This could be particularly useful for researchers who need to keep up with the latest developments in their field, as well as for educators who need to compile and present complex scientific information in an accessible way.", "example": "For instance, a researcher could use Galactica to get a summary of the latest developments in a specific field, or to find connections between their current research and other areas of study. An educator could use it to generate lecture notes or encyclopedia articles on a specific topic."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to managing scientific knowledge overload by introducing Galactica, a large language model specifically trained for this purpose. While the concept of using LLMs to manage information overload is not new, the specific application to scientific knowledge and the impressive performance of Galactica on a range of scientific tasks make this a significant contribution to the field.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it discusses the training of Galactica and its performance on various tasks. However, it does not delve into the intricate details of the model's architecture or the algorithms used, making it accessible to readers with a basic understanding of LLMs.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and presents an interesting solution to a real-world problem. The results are impressive and the potential applications of Galactica are exciting, making this an enjoyable read for anyone interested in the application of LLMs to scientific knowledge management.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
