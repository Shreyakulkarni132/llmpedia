{"Published": "2022-06-26", "Title": "Automatic Generation of Programming Exercises and Code Explanations using Large Language Models", "Authors": "Sami Sarsa, Paul Denny, Arto Hellas, Juho Leinonen", "Summary": "This article explores the natural language generation capabilities of large language models with application to the production of two types of learning resources common in programming courses. Using OpenAI Codex as the large language model, we create programming exercises (including sample solutions and test cases) and code explanations, assessing these qualitatively and quantitatively. Our results suggest that the majority of the automatically generated content is both novel and sensible, and in some cases ready to use as is. When creating exercises we find that it is remarkably easy to influence both the programming concepts and the contextual themes they contain, simply by supplying keywords as input to the model. Our analysis suggests that there is significant value in massive generative machine learning models as a tool for instructors, although there remains a need for some oversight to ensure the quality of the generated content before it is delivered to students. We further discuss the implications of OpenAI Codex and similar tools for introductory programming education and highlight future research streams that have the potential to improve the quality of the educational experience for both teachers and students alike.", "main_contribution": "The paper presents a novel application of large language models, specifically OpenAI Codex, in the generation of programming exercises and code explanations. The authors demonstrate how the model can be influenced to generate exercises and explanations based on specific programming concepts and themes by supplying keywords as input. The generated content is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively, showing that it is mostly novel, sensible, and in some cases, ready to use.", "takeaways": "The use of large language models like OpenAI Codex can significantly aid instructors in creating programming exercises and code explanations, reducing the time and effort required in manual creation. However, there is a need for oversight to ensure the quality of the generated content before it is delivered to students. This approach opens up new possibilities for enhancing the educational experience in programming courses.", "novelty_analysis": "The application of large language models in the generation of programming exercises and code explanations is a novel contribution. While large language models have been used in various domains, their use in this specific context is unique and meaningful, offering a new way to create educational resources in programming courses.", "novelty_score": 3, "category": "USE CASES", "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, discussing the use of a large language model in a specific application. It requires some understanding of programming and machine learning concepts, but is not overly complex or difficult to understand for someone with a computer science background.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents an interesting application of large language models. It offers practical insights and results, making it an enjoyable read for those interested in the intersection of machine learning and education.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
