{"Published": "2023-08-15", "Title": "RAVEN: In-Context Learning with Retrieval Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models", "Authors": "Jie Huang, Wei Ping, Peng Xu, Mohammad Shoeybi, Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang, Bryan Catanzaro", "Summary": "In this paper, we investigate the in-context learning ability of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models. We first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art ATLAS model and identify its limitations in in-context learning, primarily due to a mismatch between pretraining and testing, as well as a restricted context length. To address these issues, we propose RAVEN, a model that combines retrieval-augmented masked language modeling and prefix language modeling. We further introduce Fusion-in-Context Learning to enhance the few-shot performance by enabling the model to leverage more in-context examples without requiring additional training or model modifications. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RAVEN significantly outperforms ATLAS and achieves results comparable to the most advanced language models in certain scenarios, despite having substantially fewer parameters. Our work underscores the potential of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models for in-context learning and encourages further research in this direction.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "RAVEN: A Novel Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Model for In-Context Learning", "description": "The paper introduces RAVEN, a new retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language model designed to improve in-context learning.
