{"Published": "2023-08-15", "Title": "RAVEN: In-Context Learning with Retrieval Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models", "Authors": "Jie Huang, Wei Ping, Peng Xu, Mohammad Shoeybi, Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang, Bryan Catanzaro", "Summary": "In this paper, we investigate the in-context learning ability of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models. We first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art ATLAS model and identify its limitations in in-context learning, primarily due to a mismatch between pretraining and testing, as well as a restricted context length. To address these issues, we propose RAVEN, a model that combines retrieval-augmented masked language modeling and prefix language modeling. We further introduce Fusion-in-Context Learning to enhance the few-shot performance by enabling the model to leverage more in-context examples without requiring additional training or model modifications. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RAVEN significantly outperforms ATLAS and achieves results comparable to the most advanced language models in certain scenarios, despite having substantially fewer parameters. Our work underscores the potential of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models for in-context learning and encourages further research in this direction.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "RAVEN: Enhancing In-Context Learning in Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models", "description": "The paper presents RAVEN, a retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language model designed to improve in-context learning.

Its ability to leverage more in-context examples without requiring additional training or model modifications can significantly enhance the few-shot performance of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models. This makes RAVEN a promising model for applications that require in-context learning, such as question answering, summarization, and translation.", "example": "For instance, in a question answering task, RAVEN can leverage its retrieval-augmented masked language modeling to retrieve relevant information from an external corpus, and its prefix language modeling to align pretraining with testing. With Fusion-in-Context Learning, it can utilize more in-context examples to enhance its few-shot performance, thereby providing more accurate and contextually relevant answers."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to improving in-context learning in retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models.
