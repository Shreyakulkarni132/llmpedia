Dai", "Summary": "Successful and effective communication between humans and AI relies on a shared experience of the world. By training solely on written text, current language models (LMs) miss the grounded experience of humans in the real-world -- their failure to relate language to the physical world causes knowledge to be misrepresented and obvious mistakes in their reasoning. We present Mind's Eye, a paradigm to ground language model reasoning in the physical world. Given a physical reasoning question, we use a computational physics engine (DeepMind's MuJoCo) to simulate the possible outcomes, and then use the simulation results as part of the input, which enables language models to perform reasoning. Experiments on 39 tasks in a physics alignment benchmark demonstrate that Mind's Eye can improve reasoning ability by a large margin (27.9% zero-shot, and 46.0% few-shot absolute accuracy improvement on average). Smaller language models armed with Mind's Eye can obtain similar performance to models that are 100x larger. Finally, we confirm the robustness of Mind's Eye through ablation studies.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Mind's Eye: Grounding Language Model Reasoning in Physical World Simulations", "description": "The paper introduces Mind's Eye, a novel paradigm that grounds language model reasoning in the physical world.

This approach can be particularly useful in applications where the language model needs to reason about physical phenomena or answer questions related to the physical world. For instance, in an educational setting, an LLM equipped with Mind's Eye could be used to answer students' questions about physics or other science topics, providing more accurate and reliable answers.", "example": "For example, given a question like 'Two balls of different weights are dropped from the same height, which one hits the ground first?', the LLM with Mind's Eye would use the physics engine to simulate the scenario and provide the correct answer based on the simulation results."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by grounding them in the physical world using a computational physics engine.
