{"Published": "2023-06-28", "Title": "Towards Language Models That Can See: Computer Vision Through the LENS of Natural Language", "Authors": "William Berrios, Gautam Mittal, Tristan Thrush, Douwe Kiela, Amanpreet Singh", "Summary": "We propose LENS, a modular approach for tackling computer vision problems by leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs). Our system uses a language model to reason over outputs from a set of independent and highly descriptive vision modules that provide exhaustive information about an image. We evaluate the approach on pure computer vision settings such as zero- and few-shot object recognition, as well as on vision and language problems. LENS can be applied to any off-the-shelf LLM and we find that the LLMs with LENS perform highly competitively with much bigger and much more sophisticated systems, without any multimodal training whatsoever. We open-source our code at https://github.com/ContextualAI/lens and provide an interactive demo.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "LENS: A Modular Approach for Computer Vision Using Large Language Models", "description": "The paper introduces LENS, a novel system that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to tackle computer vision problems.

By using a language model to reason over outputs from a set of independent vision modules, LENS can be applied to any off-the-shelf LLM, making it a versatile tool for a variety of computer vision tasks. Furthermore, the fact that LENS performs competitively with larger, more sophisticated systems without requiring multimodal training makes it a cost-effective and efficient solution for computer vision problems.", "example": "For instance, an LLM practitioner could use LENS to build a system for object recognition. The system would use a language model to reason over outputs from a set of vision modules that provide exhaustive information about an image, allowing it to recognize and classify objects in the image with high accuracy."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of LENS represents a significant advancement in the field of computer vision. The system's ability to leverage the power of LLMs in a modular approach, without requiring multimodal training, sets it apart from existing methods.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it delves into the workings of LENS and how it uses a language model to reason over outputs from a set of vision modules. However, the concepts are explained clearly and should be accessible to readers with a background in AI and machine learning.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and presents an interesting and novel approach to computer vision using LLMs. The clear explanations and practical applications make it an engaging read for those interested in the field.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
