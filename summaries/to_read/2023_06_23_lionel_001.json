In particular, how do humans make meaning from language--and how can we leverage a theory of linguistic meaning to build machines that think in more human-like ways? In this paper, we propose rational meaning construction, a computational framework for language-informed thinking that combines neural language models with probabilistic models for rational inference. We frame linguistic meaning as a context-sensitive mapping from natural language into a probabilistic language of thought (PLoT)--a general-purpose symbolic substrate for generative world modeling. Our architecture integrates two computational tools that have not previously come together: we model thinking with probabilistic programs, an expressive representation for commonsense reasoning; and we model meaning construction with large language models (LLMs), which support broad-coverage translation from natural language utterances to code expressions in a probabilistic programming language. We illustrate our framework through examples covering four core domains from cognitive science: probabilistic reasoning, logical and relational reasoning, visual and physical reasoning, and social reasoning. In each, we show that LLMs can generate context-sensitive translations that capture pragmatically-appropriate linguistic meanings, while Bayesian inference with the generated programs supports coherent and robust commonsense reasoning. We extend our framework to integrate cognitively-motivated symbolic modules (physics simulators, graphics engines, and planning algorithms) to provide a unified commonsense thinking interface from language. Finally, we explore how language can drive the construction of world models themselves. We hope this work will provide a roadmap towards cognitive models and AI systems that synthesize the insights of both modern and classical computational perspectives.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Rational Meaning Construction: A Framework for Language-Informed Thinking", "description": "The paper introduces a computational framework called 'Rational Meaning Construction' that combines neural language models with probabilistic models for rational inference. This framework maps natural language into a probabilistic language of thought (PLoT), a symbolic substrate for generative world modeling. The authors integrate probabilistic programs for modeling thinking and large language models (LLMs) for meaning construction. The framework is demonstrated across four core domains from cognitive science: probabilistic reasoning, logical and relational reasoning, visual and physical reasoning, and social reasoning.

This approach can be used to improve the performance of LLMs in tasks that require commonsense reasoning. Additionally, the integration of symbolic modules like physics simulators and graphics engines can provide a unified commonsense thinking interface from language.", "example": "For instance, an LLM using this framework could be given a natural language input like 'The cat is on the mat.' The framework would translate this into a probabilistic language of thought, allowing the LLM to reason about the physical implications of this statement, such as the cat's location and the potential for the mat to be occupied."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to integrating neural language models with probabilistic models for rational inference.
