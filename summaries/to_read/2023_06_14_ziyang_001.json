However, most existing models are solely pre-trained on extensive raw code data without instruction fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce WizardCoder, which empowers Code LLMs with complex instruction fine-tuning, by adapting the Evol-Instruct method to the domain of code. Through comprehensive experiments on four prominent code generation benchmarks, namely HumanEval, HumanEval+, MBPP, and DS-1000, we unveil the exceptional capabilities of our model. It surpasses all other open-source Code LLMs by a substantial margin. Moreover, our model even outperforms the largest closed LLMs, Anthropic's Claude and Google's Bard, on HumanEval and HumanEval+. Our code, model weights, and data are public at https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM", "main_contribution": {"headline": "WizardCoder: Enhancing Code LLMs with Complex Instruction Fine-Tuning", "description": "The paper introduces WizardCoder, a novel approach to enhancing Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) with complex instruction fine-tuning. The authors adapt the Evol-Instruct method, previously used in the general domain, to the domain of code. This involves evolving existing instruction data to generate more complex and diverse datasets, specifically tailored for code-related tasks. The method includes refining the evolutionary instructions, simplifying the form of evolutionary prompts, and incorporating code debugging and time-space complexity constraints. The resulting WizardCoder model outperforms all other open-source Code LLMs and even some of the largest closed LLMs."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Complex Instruction Fine-Tuning Enhances Code LLMs", "description": "The WizardCoder approach demonstrates that complex instruction fine-tuning can significantly enhance the performance of Code LLMs. By adapting the Evol-Instruct method to the domain of code, the authors were able to generate more complex and diverse datasets for fine-tuning. This approach could be used to improve the performance of other Code LLMs, potentially leading to more accurate and efficient code generation and understanding. The authors have made their code, model weights, and data publicly available, allowing other researchers and practitioners to build upon their work.", "example": "For instance, a practitioner could use the WizardCoder approach to fine-tune their own Code LLM. They would start by evolving their existing instruction data using the methods described in the paper, then use this new dataset to fine-tune their model. This could lead to improved performance on code-related tasks."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to enhancing Code LLMs by adapting the Evol-Instruct method to the domain of code.
