Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Our models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and based on our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, may be a suitable substitute for closed-source models. We provide a detailed description of our approach to fine-tuning and safety improvements of Llama 2-Chat in order to enable the community to build on our work and contribute to the responsible development of LLMs.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Llama 2: A collection of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs optimized for dialogue use cases", "description": "The paper presents Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) with a scale ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.

These models can be used to build more efficient and safer chatbots or virtual assistants. The detailed description of the fine-tuning and safety improvement process can serve as a guide for practitioners working on similar projects. The models' performance on benchmarks also suggests that they can be a viable alternative to closed-source models.", "example": "For instance, an LLM practitioner can use the Llama 2-Chat models to build a chatbot for customer service. The fine-tuning process can be adjusted based on the specific needs of the project, and the safety improvements can help ensure that the chatbot responds appropriately to user inputs."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a significant contribution in the form of Llama 2-Chat models, which are optimized for dialogue use cases.
