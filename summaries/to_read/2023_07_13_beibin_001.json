{"Published": "2023-07-13", "Title": "Large Language Models for Supply Chain Optimization", "Authors": "Beibin Li, Konstantina Mellou, Bo Zhang, Jeevan Pathuri, Ishai Menache", "Summary": "Supply chain operations traditionally involve a variety of complex decision making problems. Over the last few decades, supply chains greatly benefited from advances in computation, which allowed the transition from manual processing to automation and cost-effective optimization. Nonetheless, business operators still need to spend substantial efforts in explaining and interpreting the optimization outcomes to stakeholders. Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we study how this disruptive technology can help bridge the gap between supply chain automation and human comprehension and trust thereof. We design OptiGuide -- a framework that accepts as input queries in plain text, and outputs insights about the underlying optimization outcomes. Our framework does not forgo the state-of-the-art combinatorial optimization technology, but rather leverages it to quantitatively answer what-if scenarios (e.g., how would the cost change if we used supplier B instead of supplier A for a given demand?). Importantly, our design does not require sending proprietary data over to LLMs, which can be a privacy concern in some circumstances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a real server placement scenario within Microsoft's cloud supply chain. Along the way, we develop a general evaluation benchmark, which can be used to evaluate the accuracy of the LLM output in other scenarios.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "OptiGuide: A Framework for Interpreting Supply Chain Optimization Outcomes Using LLMs", "description": "The paper introduces OptiGuide, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and explain supply chain optimization outcomes.

It can help business operators understand and explain complex optimization outcomes, reducing the need for time-consuming interactions with data scientists and engineers. The framework's ability to answer what-if scenarios quantitatively can aid in decision-making processes. Moreover, its design ensures data privacy, a critical aspect in business operations.", "example": "For instance, a business operator could use OptiGuide to ask: 'How would the cost change if we used supplier B instead of supplier A for a given demand?'. The LLM would then leverage the underlying optimization technology to provide a quantitative answer, aiding the operator in making an informed decision."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel application of LLMs in the field of supply chain management.
