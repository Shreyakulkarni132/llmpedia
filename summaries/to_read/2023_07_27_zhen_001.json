TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanism, tensor normalization, inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism to smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over 20%. Furthermore, we have developed a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. Scalability is at the heart of our model's design, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, all while maintaining outstanding performance metrics. Rigorous validation of our model design is achieved through a series of comprehensive experiments on our self-collected corpus, boasting a size exceeding 6TB and containing over 2 trillion tokens. To ensure data quality and relevance, we implement a new self-cleaning strategy to filter our collected data. Our pre-trained models will be released to foster community advancements in efficient LLMs.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "TransNormerLLM: A Linear Attention-Based Large Language Model with Superior Efficiency and Accuracy", "description": "The paper introduces TransNormerLLM, a linear attention-based Large Language Model (LLM) that surpasses conventional softmax attention-based models in both accuracy and efficiency.
