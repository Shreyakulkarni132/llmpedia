{"Published": "2023-04-26", "Title": "The Internal State of an LLM Knows When its Lying", "Authors": "Amos Azaria, Tom Mitchell", "Summary": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in various tasks, their (arguably) most prominent drawback is generating inaccurate or false information with a confident tone. In this paper, we hypothesize that the LLM's internal state can be used to reveal the truthfulness of a statement. Therefore, we introduce a simple yet effective method to detect the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements, which utilizes the LLM's hidden layer activations to determine the veracity of statements. To train and evaluate our method, we compose a dataset of true and false statements in six different topics. A classifier is trained to detect which statement is true or false based on an LLM's activation values. Specifically, the classifier receives as input the activation values from the LLM for each of the statements in the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that our method for detecting statement veracity significantly outperforms even few-shot prompting methods, highlighting its potential to enhance the reliability of LLM-generated content and its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "LLM's internal state can reveal the truthfulness of its generated statements", "description": "The paper introduces a novel method to detect the truthfulness of statements generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) by utilizing the LLM's hidden layer activations.

This can be particularly useful in applications where the accuracy of information is critical, such as in news generation or fact-checking systems. The method involves training a classifier on the activation values from the LLM for each statement in a dataset of true and false statements.", "example": "For instance, an LLM can be used to generate a news article. The activation values from the LLM for each statement in the article can then be fed into the trained classifier to determine the truthfulness of each statement. This can help ensure the accuracy of the generated content."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to detecting the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements by utilizing the LLM's internal state.
