Rigorous Evaluation of Large Language Models for Code Generation", "Authors": "Jiawei Liu, Chunqiu Steven Xia, Yuyao Wang, Lingming Zhang", "Summary": "Program synthesis has been long studied with recent approaches focused on directly using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. Programming benchmarks, with curated synthesis problems and test-cases, are used to measure the performance of various LLMs on code synthesis. However, these test-cases can be limited in both quantity and quality for fully assessing the functional correctness of the generated code. Such limitation in the existing benchmarks begs the following question: In the era of LLMs, is the code generated really correct? To answer this, we propose EvalPlus -- a code synthesis benchmarking framework to rigorously evaluate the functional correctness of LLM-synthesized code. EvalPlus augments a given evaluation dataset with large amounts of test-cases newly produced by an automatic test input generator, powered by both LLM- and mutation-based strategies. While EvalPlus is general, we extend the test-cases of the popular HUMANEVAL benchmark by 81x to build HUMANEVAL+. Our extensive evaluation across 19 popular LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 and ChatGPT) demonstrates that HUMANEVAL+ is able to catch significant amounts of previously undetected wrong code synthesized by LLMs, reducing the pass@k by 13.6-15.3% on average. Our work not only indicates that prior popular code synthesis evaluation results do not accurately reflect the true performance of LLMs for code synthesis, but also opens up a new direction to improve such programming benchmarks through automated testing.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "EvalPlus: A rigorous evaluation framework for LLM-synthesized code", "description": "The paper introduces EvalPlus, a code synthesis benchmarking framework designed to rigorously evaluate the functional correctness of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).
