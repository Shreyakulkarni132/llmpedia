{"Published": "2021-10-04", "Title": "Structured abbreviation expansion in context", "Authors": "Kyle Gorman, Christo Kirov, Brian Roark, Richard Sproat", "Summary": "Ad hoc abbreviations are commonly found in informal communication channels that favor shorter messages. We consider the task of reversing these abbreviations in context to recover normalized, expanded versions of abbreviated messages. The problem is related to, but distinct from, spelling correction, in that ad hoc abbreviations are intentional and may involve substantial differences from the original words. Ad hoc abbreviations are productively generated on-the-fly, so they cannot be resolved solely by dictionary lookup. We generate a large, open-source data set of ad hoc abbreviations. This data is used to study abbreviation strategies and to develop two strong baselines for abbreviation expansion", "main_contribution": "The paper introduces a new open-source dataset of ad hoc abbreviations, which are commonly found in informal communication channels. The authors also develop two strong baseline models for abbreviation expansion, one finite-state and one neural. These models use a noisy channel approach, combining an abbreviation model applied independently to each word in the sentence, and a language model enforcing fluency and local coherence in the expansion.", "takeaways": "The introduction of this dataset and the baseline models can be beneficial for researchers and practitioners working on text normalization, especially in the context of informal communication channels. The models can help in reversing ad hoc abbreviations to recover normalized, expanded versions of abbreviated messages, which can be useful in various natural language processing tasks.", "novelty_analysis": "The creation of a large, open-source dataset of ad hoc abbreviations and the development of two strong baseline models for abbreviation expansion represent significant contributions to the field of text normalization. While the concept of abbreviation expansion is not new, the focus on ad hoc abbreviations and the creation of a dedicated dataset for this purpose add novelty to the work.", "novelty_score": 2, "category": "USE CASES", "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, discussing the creation of a new dataset and the development of two baseline models for abbreviation expansion. However, the concepts are explained clearly, making it accessible to those with a background in computer science or natural language processing.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents an interesting problem in the field of text normalization. The creation of a new dataset and the development of baseline models add practical value to the work, making it an enjoyable read for those interested in the field.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
