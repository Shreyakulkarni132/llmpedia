{"Published": "2023-05-31", "Title": "Getting More out of Large Language Models for Proofs", "Authors": "Shizhuo Dylan Zhang, Talia Ringer, Emily First", "Summary": "Large language models have the potential to simplify formal theorem proving and make it more accessible. But how to get the most out of these models is still an open question. To answer this question, we take a step back and explore the failure cases of these models using common prompting-based techniques. Our talk will discuss these failure cases and what they can teach us about how to get more out of these models.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Exploring the failure cases of LLMs in formal theorem proving", "description": "The paper investigates the failure cases of large language models (LLMs) in formal theorem proving, specifically using the state-of-the-art models GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4. The authors conduct a fine-grained analysis of model outputs on an example project, focusing on how these outputs commonly go wrong. The study provides insights into how to get more out of these models in the context of formal theorem proving. The authors suggest allowing the model to prompt the proof assistant for more information and giving the model access to proof states to improve their performance."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "LLMs can be improved for formal theorem proving by addressing failure cases", "description": "The paper provides valuable insights for LLM practitioners working on formal theorem proving. It suggests that allowing the model to prompt the proof assistant for more information and giving the model access to proof states can improve their performance. These insights can be used to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in formal theorem proving, making them more efficient and reliable.", "example": "For instance, if an LLM is struggling with a theorem, it could be prompted to ask the proof assistant for more information about the definitions of referenced variables. Additionally, giving the model access to the current proof state can prevent it from making incorrect assumptions, such as introducing too many variables."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper provides a unique perspective by focusing on the failure cases of LLMs in formal theorem proving, which is not commonly addressed in the literature. The recommendations provided are based on a detailed analysis of these failure cases, making the findings novel and significant.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical as it delves into the specifics of how LLMs function in the context of formal theorem proving. It requires a basic understanding of LLMs and formal theorem proving, but does not involve complex mathematical theories or algorithms.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and provides a unique perspective on the use of LLMs in formal theorem proving. The focus on failure cases and the detailed analysis make it an interesting read for those interested in the field.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
