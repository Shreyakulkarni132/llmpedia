Despite this progress, LLMs are still unable to solve algorithmic reasoning problems. While providing a rationale with the final answer has led to further improvements in multi-step reasoning problems, Anil et al. 2022 showed that even simple algorithmic reasoning tasks such as parity are far from solved. In this work, we identify and study four key stages for successfully teaching algorithmic reasoning to LLMs: (1) formulating algorithms as skills, (2) teaching multiple skills simultaneously (skill accumulation), (3) teaching how to combine skills (skill composition) and (4) teaching how to use skills as tools. We show that it is possible to teach algorithmic reasoning to LLMs via in-context learning, which we refer to as algorithmic prompting. We evaluate our approach on a variety of arithmetic and quantitative reasoning tasks, and demonstrate significant boosts in performance over existing prompting techniques. In particular, for long parity, addition, multiplication and subtraction, we achieve an error reduction of approximately 10x, 9x, 5x and 2x respectively compared to the best available baselines.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Teaching Algorithmic Reasoning to LLMs via In-Context Learning", "description": "The paper presents a novel approach to teaching algorithmic reasoning to Large Language Models (LLMs) through in-context learning, termed as 'algorithmic prompting'.

By treating algorithms as skills and teaching them in a structured manner, LLM practitioners can improve the models' performance on complex reasoning tasks. This approach can be particularly useful in applications that require multi-step reasoning or algorithmic problem-solving, such as advanced natural language understanding, code generation, or mathematical problem-solving.", "example": "For instance, an LLM trained using this approach could be used to develop an advanced AI tutor for mathematics.
