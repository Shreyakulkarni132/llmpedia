{"Published": "2023-05-15", "Title": "Interactive Fashion Content Generation Using LLMs and Latent Diffusion Models", "Authors": "Krishna Sri Ipsit Mantri, Nevasini Sasikumar", "Summary": "Fashionable image generation aims to synthesize images of diverse fashion prevalent around the globe, helping fashion designers in real-time visualization by giving them a basic customized structure of how a specific design preference would look in real life and what further improvements can be made for enhanced customer satisfaction. Moreover, users can alone interact and generate fashionable images by just giving a few simple prompts. Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity as generative models owing to their flexibility and generation of realistic images from Gaussian noise. Latent diffusion models are a type of generative model that use diffusion processes to model the generation of complex data, such as images, audio, or text. They are called \"latent\" because they learn a hidden representation, or latent variable, of the data that captures its underlying structure. We propose a method exploiting the equivalence between diffusion models and energy-based models (EBMs) and suggesting ways to compose multiple probability distributions. We describe a pipeline on how our method can be used specifically for new fashionable outfit generation and virtual try-on using LLM-guided text-to-image generation. Our results indicate that using an LLM to refine the prompts to the latent diffusion model assists in generating globally creative and culturally diversified fashion styles and reducing bias.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Interactive Fashion Content Generation Using LLMs and Latent Diffusion Models", "description": "The paper presents a novel method for generating fashionable images using Large Language Models (LLMs) and latent diffusion models.

By using LLMs to refine the prompts to the latent diffusion model, the system can generate globally creative and culturally diversified fashion styles. This can be particularly useful for fashion designers and online retailers, as it allows them to visualize how different outfits and accessories would look on different body types, thereby helping customers make more informed decisions when shopping online.", "example": "For instance, an online retailer could use this method to generate images of different outfits based on a user's input. The user could input a few simple prompts, such as 'summer dress with floral print', and the system would generate an image of what the dress would look like. The retailer could then use this image to help the user visualize how the dress would look on them."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel method for generating fashionable images using LLMs and latent diffusion models. While the use of LLMs and diffusion models in image generation is not new, the application of these techniques in the field of fashion is a unique contribution.", "novelty_score": 2, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical as it discusses the workings of latent diffusion models and energy-based models (EBMs), and how they can be used in conjunction with LLMs to generate fashionable images. However, the authors do a good job of explaining these concepts in a way that is accessible to readers with a basic understanding of AI and machine learning.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and presents an interesting application of LLMs and diffusion models in the field of fashion. The authors provide clear explanations of the technical concepts and include examples to illustrate how their method can be used in practice, making it an enjoyable read for those interested in the intersection of AI and fashion.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
