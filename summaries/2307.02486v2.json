{"Published": "2023-07-19", "Title": "LongNet: Scaling Transformers to 1,000,000,000 Tokens", "Authors": "Jiayu Ding, Shuming Ma, Li Dong, Xingxing Zhang, Shaohan Huang, Wenhui Wang, Nanning Zheng, Furu Wei", "Summary": "Scaling sequence length has become a critical demand in the era of large language models. However, existing methods struggle with either computational complexity or model expressivity, rendering the maximum sequence length restricted. To address this issue, we introduce LongNet, a Transformer variant that can scale sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens, without sacrificing the performance on shorter sequences. Specifically, we propose dilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. LongNet has significant advantages: 1) it has a linear computation complexity and a logarithm dependency between any two tokens in a sequence; 2) it can be served as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-in replacement for standard attention, which can be seamlessly integrated with the existing Transformer-based optimization. Experiments results demonstrate that LongNet yields strong performance on both long-sequence modeling and general language tasks. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling very long sequences, e.g., treating a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as a sequence.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "LongNet: A Transformer variant for scaling sequence length to over 1 billion tokens", "description": "The paper introduces LongNet, a novel Transformer variant designed to scale sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens without compromising performance on shorter sequences. The key innovation is the introduction of 'dilated attention', which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. This allows LongNet to maintain a linear computational complexity and a logarithmic dependency between any two tokens in a sequence. Furthermore, LongNet can serve as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences and its dilated attention can be seamlessly integrated with existing Transformer-based optimization as a drop-in replacement for standard attention."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "LongNet enables efficient modeling of extremely long sequences in LLMs", "description": "LongNet's ability to handle extremely long sequences opens up new possibilities for LLM practitioners. It can be used to model very long sequences, such as an entire corpus or even the entire Internet, as a sequence. This could be particularly useful in tasks that require understanding of long-term dependencies or context, such as summarizing a long document or understanding the context of a conversation in a chatbot application. The dilated attention mechanism can also be integrated into existing Transformer models to improve their efficiency on long sequences.", "example": "For instance, an LLM using LongNet could be used to analyze an entire book in a single pass, understanding the context from the beginning to the end of the book. This could be used to generate a comprehensive summary or answer questions about the book."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of LongNet and the concept of dilated attention represent a significant advancement in the field of LLMs. The ability to scale sequence length to over 1 billion tokens without sacrificing performance on shorter sequences is a novel contribution that pushes the boundaries of what is currently possible with LLMs.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is highly technical, delving into the details of the LongNet architecture and the dilated attention mechanism.
