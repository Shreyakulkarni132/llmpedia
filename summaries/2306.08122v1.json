{"Published": "2023-06-13", "Title": "Beyond Black Box AI-Generated Plagiarism Detection: From Sentence to Document Level", "Authors": "Mujahid Ali Quidwai, Chunhui Li, Parijat Dube", "Summary": "The increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) in academic writing has led to a rise in plagiarism. Existing AI-generated text classifiers have limited accuracy and often produce false positives. We propose a novel approach using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, offering quantifiable metrics at both sentence and document levels for easier interpretation by human evaluators. Our method employs a multi-faceted approach, generating multiple paraphrased versions of a given question and inputting them into the LLM to generate answers. By using a contrastive loss function based on cosine similarity, we match generated sentences with those from the student's response. Our approach achieves up to 94% accuracy in classifying human and AI text, providing a robust and adaptable solution for plagiarism detection in academic settings. This method improves with LLM advancements, reducing the need for new model training or reconfiguration, and offers a more transparent way of evaluating and detecting AI-generated text.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Novel NLP approach for detecting AI-generated plagiarism with high accuracy", "description": "The paper presents a novel approach for detecting plagiarism in academic writing, specifically focusing on text generated by large language models (LLMs).

It offers a high degree of accuracy and is designed to improve with advancements in LLMs, reducing the need for new model training or reconfiguration. This approach could be integrated into existing plagiarism detection tools to enhance their performance and adaptability. For instance, an LLM practitioner could use this method to develop a plagiarism detection tool that generates multiple paraphrased versions of a given text and compares them with the original text to detect potential plagiarism.", "example": "For instance, given a student's response to a question, the tool could generate multiple paraphrased versions of the question and input them into an LLM. The LLM would generate answers, which would then be compared with the student's response using a contrastive loss function based on cosine similarity. If the similarity score exceeds a certain threshold, the response could be flagged as potential plagiarism."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to detecting AI-generated plagiarism, which is a growing concern in academic settings.
