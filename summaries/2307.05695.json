In this paper, we explore low-rank training techniques as an alternative approach to training large neural networks. We introduce a novel method called ReLoRA, which utilizes low-rank updates to train high-rank networks. We apply ReLoRA to pre-training transformer language models with up to 350M parameters and demonstrate comparable performance to regular neural network training. Furthermore, we observe that the efficiency of ReLoRA increases with model size, making it a promising approach for training multi-billion-parameter networks efficiently. Our findings shed light on the potential of low-rank training techniques and their implications for scaling laws.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "ReLoRA: A novel method for efficient training of large neural networks", "description": "The paper introduces a new method called ReLoRA (Regularized Low-Rank Approximation), which uses low-rank updates to train high-rank networks.
