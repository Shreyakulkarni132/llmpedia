{"Published": "2023-05-25", "Title": "HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in Hugging Face", "Authors": "Yongliang Shen, Kaitao Song, Xu Tan, Dongsheng Li, Weiming Lu, Yueting Zhuang", "Summary": "Solving complicated AI tasks with different domains and modalities is a key step toward artificial general intelligence. While there are abundant AI models available for different domains and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI tasks. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional ability in language understanding, generation, interaction, and reasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks and language could be a generic interface to empower this. Based on this philosophy, we present HuggingGPT, a framework that leverages LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to connect various AI models in machine learning communities (e.g., Hugging Face) to solve AI tasks. Specifically, we use ChatGPT to conduct task planning when receiving a user request, select models according to their function descriptions available in Hugging Face, execute each subtask with the selected AI model, and summarize the response according to the execution results. By leveraging the strong language capability of ChatGPT and abundant AI models in Hugging Face, HuggingGPT is able to cover numerous sophisticated AI tasks in different modalities and domains and achieve impressive results in language, vision, speech, and other challenging tasks, which paves a new way towards artificial general intelligence.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "HuggingGPT: A Framework Leveraging LLMs to Connect and Manage Various AI Models", "description": "The paper introduces HuggingGPT, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as a controller to manage various AI models for solving complex AI tasks.
