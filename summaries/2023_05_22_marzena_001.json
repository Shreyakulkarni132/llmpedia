{"Published": "2023-05-22", "Title": "Large language models effectively leverage document-level context for literary translation, but critical errors persist", "Authors": "Marzena Karpinska, Mohit Iyyer", "Summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are competitive with the state of the art on a wide range of sentence-level translation datasets. However, their ability to translate paragraphs and documents remains unexplored because evaluation in these settings is costly and difficult. We show through a rigorous human evaluation that asking the Gpt-3.5 (text-davinci-003) LLM to translate an entire literary paragraph (e.g., from a novel) at once results in higher-quality translations than standard sentence-by-sentence translation across 18 linguistically-diverse language pairs (e.g., translating into and out of Japanese, Polish, and English). Our evaluation, which took approximately 350 hours of effort for annotation and analysis, is conducted by hiring translators fluent in both the source and target language and asking them to provide both span-level error annotations as well as preference judgments of which system's translations are better. We observe that discourse-level LLM translators commit fewer mistranslations, grammar errors, and stylistic inconsistencies than sentence-level approaches. With that said, critical errors still abound, including occasional content omissions, and a human translator's intervention remains necessary to ensure that the author's voice remains intact. We publicly release our dataset and error annotations to spur future research on evaluation of document-level literary translation.", "main_contribution": "The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the GPT-3.5's ability to translate literary paragraphs across 18 different language pairs. The authors demonstrate that translating an entire paragraph at once results in higher-quality translations than standard sentence-by-sentence translation. The evaluation process involved hiring translators fluent in both the source and target language, who provided error annotations and preference judgments.", "takeaways": "The findings suggest that GPT-3.5 can effectively leverage discourse-level context to produce higher-quality translations. However, the study also highlights that critical errors, including content omissions, still occur, necessitating human intervention. The authors' release of their dataset and error annotations can aid future research in document-level literary translation.", "novelty_analysis": "The novelty of this paper lies in its exploration of LLMs' ability to translate literary paragraphs, an area that has been largely unexplored due to the cost and difficulty of evaluation. The rigorous human evaluation process and the comparison of paragraph-level translation with sentence-level translation provide new insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this context.", "novelty_score": 2, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it delves into the specifics of the evaluation process and the types of errors encountered in the translations. However, the concepts are explained clearly, making it accessible to those with a basic understanding of LLMs and translation.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents an interesting exploration of LLMs in the context of literary translation. The detailed analysis of the evaluation process and the findings make for an engaging read.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
