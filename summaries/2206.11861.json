{"Published": "2022-06-26", "Title": "Automatic Generation of Programming Exercises and Code Explanations using Large Language Models", "Authors": "Sami Sarsa, Paul Denny, Arto Hellas, Juho Leinonen", "Summary": "This article explores the natural language generation capabilities of large language models with application to the production of two types of learning resources common in programming courses. Using OpenAI Codex as the large language model, we create programming exercises (including sample solutions and test cases) and code explanations, assessing these qualitatively and quantitatively. Our results suggest that the majority of the automatically generated content is both novel and sensible, and in some cases ready to use as is. When creating exercises we find that it is remarkably easy to influence both the programming concepts and the contextual themes they contain, simply by supplying keywords as input to the model. Our analysis suggests that there is significant value in massive generative machine learning models as a tool for instructors, although there remains a need for some oversight to ensure the quality of the generated content before it is delivered to students. We further discuss the implications of OpenAI Codex and similar tools for introductory programming education and highlight future research streams that have the potential to improve the quality of the educational experience for both teachers and students alike.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Large Language Models Generate Programming Exercises and Code Explanations", "description": "The paper demonstrates the use of OpenAI Codex, a large language model, to generate programming exercises and code explanations. The authors show that the model can produce novel and sensible content, which in some cases is ready to use without modification. The model can be influenced to generate exercises around specific programming concepts and themes by supplying relevant keywords. However, the authors note that some oversight is required to ensure the quality of the generated content before it is used in a learning context."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "LLMs Can Be Used to Generate Learning Resources for Programming Education", "description": "The paper shows that large language models can be used to generate programming exercises and code explanations, which can be used as learning resources in programming education. This can help educators to create a large number of novel exercises, overcoming the challenge of creating sufficient quantity of novel exercises. However, the generated content needs to be reviewed for quality before it is used. The model can be influenced to generate exercises around specific programming concepts and themes by supplying relevant keywords.", "example": "For instance, to generate an exercise around the concept of 'classes' in Python, one could input the keyword 'classes' to the model. The model would then generate an exercise that requires the student to create a class, along with a sample solution and test cases."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The use of large language models to generate programming exercises and code explanations is a novel application of these models. While the use of AI in education is not new, the specific application of generating learning resources for programming education is a unique contribution of this paper.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is not overly technical. It describes the use of a large language model to generate programming exercises and code explanations, but does not delve into the technical details of how the model works or how it was trained.", "technical_score": 1, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and presents a novel application of large language models. It is easy to read and understand, and the implications of the work for programming education are clearly discussed.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
