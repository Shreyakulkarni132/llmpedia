{"Published": "2023-05-24", "Title": "Science in the Era of ChatGPT, Large Language Models and AI: Challenges for Research Ethics Review and How to Respond", "Authors": "Evangelos Pournaras", "Summary": "Large language models of artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT find remarkable but controversial applicability in science and research. This paper reviews epistemological challenges, ethical and integrity risks in science conduct. This is with the aim to lay new timely foundations for a high-quality research ethics review in the era of AI. The role of AI language models as a research instrument and subject is scrutinized along with ethical implications for scientists, participants and reviewers. Ten recommendations shape a response for a more responsible research conduct with AI language models.", "main_contribution": "The paper critically examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in scientific research, highlighting the ethical and integrity risks associated with their use. It scrutinizes the role of AI language models as both a research instrument and subject, and discusses the ethical implications for scientists, participants, and reviewers. The paper also proposes ten recommendations to guide more responsible research conduct with AI language models.", "takeaways": "The paper underscores the need for a high-quality research ethics review in the era of AI. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the limitations and potential risks of using AI language models in scientific research, such as the generation of incorrect or misleading information, and the potential for harmful instructions or biased content. The proposed recommendations provide a roadmap for researchers to navigate these challenges and conduct responsible research with AI language models.", "novelty_analysis": "The paper provides a comprehensive review of the ethical and integrity risks associated with the use of AI language models in scientific research, which is a relatively unexplored area. The proposed recommendations also represent a novel contribution to the field, providing practical guidance for researchers.", "novelty_score": 3, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "technical_analysis": "The paper is not overly technical, as it primarily focuses on the ethical and integrity risks associated with the use of AI language models in scientific research, rather than the technical aspects of these models.", "technical_score": 1, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and thought-provoking, providing a critical examination of a timely and important issue. It is likely to be of interest to a wide range of readers, including researchers, ethicists, and policymakers.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
