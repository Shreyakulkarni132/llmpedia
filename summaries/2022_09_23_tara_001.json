{"Published": "2022-09-23", "Title": "CascadER: Cross-Modal Cascading for Knowledge Graph Link Prediction", "Authors": "Tara Safavi, Doug Downey, Tom Hope", "Summary": "Knowledge graph (KG) link prediction is a fundamental task in artificial intelligence, with applications in natural language processing, information retrieval, and biomedicine. Recently, promising results have been achieved by leveraging cross-modal information in KGs, using ensembles that combine knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and contextual language models (LMs). However, existing ensembles are either (1) not consistently effective in terms of ranking accuracy gains or (2) impractically inefficient on larger datasets due to the combinatorial explosion problem of pairwise ranking with deep language models. In this paper, we propose a novel tiered ranking architecture CascadER to maintain the ranking accuracy of full ensembling while improving efficiency considerably. CascadER uses LMs to rerank the outputs of more efficient base KGEs, relying on an adaptive subset selection scheme aimed at invoking the LMs minimally while maximizing accuracy gain over the KGE. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CascadER improves MRR by up to 9 points over KGE baselines, setting new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks while improving efficiency by one or more orders of magnitude over competitive cross-modal baselines. Our empirical analyses reveal that diversity of models across modalities and preservation of individual models' confidence signals help explain the effectiveness of CascadER, and suggest promising directions for cross-modal cascaded architectures. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/tsafavi/cascader.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "CascadER: A novel tiered ranking architecture for efficient knowledge graph link prediction", "description": "The paper introduces CascadER, a novel tiered ranking architecture designed to improve the efficiency of knowledge graph link prediction.

By using LMs to rerank the outputs of base KGEs, it reduces the computational cost associated with the combinatorial explosion problem of pairwise ranking with deep language models. This could be particularly useful for LLM practitioners working with large datasets, where efficiency is a key concern. The adaptive subset selection scheme also ensures that the accuracy of the predictions is not compromised, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.", "example": "For instance, in a recommendation system, CascadER could be used to efficiently predict the likelihood of a user liking a particular item based on their past behavior. The base KGEs would first rank the items, and then the LMs would rerank a subset of these items to improve the accuracy of the predictions."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "CascadER introduces a novel approach to knowledge graph link prediction by combining the strengths of KGEs and LMs in a tiered ranking architecture.
