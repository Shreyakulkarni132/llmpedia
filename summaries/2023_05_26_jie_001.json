{"Published": "2023-05-26", "Title": "Towards Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Survey", "Authors": "Jie Huang, Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang", "Summary": "Reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence that plays a crucial role in activities such as problem solving, decision making, and critical thinking. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in natural language processing, and there is observation that these models may exhibit reasoning abilities when they are sufficiently large. However, it is not yet clear to what extent LLMs are capable of reasoning. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on reasoning in LLMs, including techniques for improving and eliciting reasoning in these models, methods and benchmarks for evaluating reasoning abilities, findings and implications of previous research in this field, and suggestions on future directions. Our aim is to provide a detailed and up-to-date review of this topic and stimulate meaningful discussion and future work.", "main_contribution": "The paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current state of knowledge on reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). It does not introduce a new algorithm or technique, but rather collates and discusses existing techniques for improving and eliciting reasoning in LLMs, methods and benchmarks for evaluating reasoning abilities, and the findings and implications of previous research in this field. The paper also offers suggestions on future directions for research in this area.", "takeaways": "The paper serves as a valuable resource for LLM practitioners, providing a detailed and up-to-date review of the topic of reasoning in LLMs. It offers insights into the techniques for enhancing reasoning in LLMs, methods for evaluating reasoning abilities, and the implications of previous research. This comprehensive overview can guide practitioners in their work and stimulate meaningful discussion and future work in the field.", "novelty_analysis": "The novelty of this paper lies in its comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on reasoning in LLMs. While it does not introduce new techniques or algorithms, it collates and discusses a wide range of existing research, providing a valuable resource for practitioners and researchers in the field.", "novelty_score": 2, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical as it discusses various techniques for improving and eliciting reasoning in LLMs, methods and benchmarks for evaluating reasoning abilities, and the findings and implications of previous research. However, it is written in a clear and comprehensive manner, making it accessible to those with a background in computer science.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and provides a comprehensive overview of a complex topic, making it an enjoyable read for those interested in the field of LLMs and reasoning. The clear and comprehensive writing style, along with the insightful discussion of the topic, contributes to its readability.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
