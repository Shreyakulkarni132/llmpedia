For instance, OpenAI devoted six months to iteratively aligning GPT-4 before its release [3]. However, a major challenge faced by practitioners is the lack of clear guidance on evaluating whether LLM outputs align with social norms, values, and regulations. This obstacle hinders systematic iteration and deployment of LLMs. To address this issue, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of key dimensions that are crucial to consider when assessing LLM trustworthiness. The survey covers seven major categories of LLM trustworthiness: reliability, safety, fairness, resistance to misuse, explainability and reasoning, adherence to social norms, and robustness. Each major category is further divided into several sub-categories, resulting in a total of 29 sub-categories. Additionally, a subset of 8 sub-categories is selected for further investigation, where corresponding measurement studies are designed and conducted on several widely-used LLMs. The measurement results indicate that, in general, more aligned models tend to perform better in terms of overall trustworthiness. However, the effectiveness of alignment varies across the different trustworthiness categories considered. This highlights the importance of conducting more fine-grained analyses, testing, and making continuous improvements on LLM alignment. By shedding light on these key dimensions of LLM trustworthiness, this paper aims to provide valuable insights and guidance to practitioners in the field. Understanding and addressing these concerns will be crucial in achieving reliable and ethically sound deployment of LLMs in various applications.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Comprehensive Survey and Guideline for Evaluating Large Language Models\u2019 Alignment", "description": "The paper presents a comprehensive survey of key dimensions that are crucial to consider when assessing the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs).

It provides a robust and detailed taxonomy for evaluating alignment, which can guide researchers and developers in creating LLMs that align better with human values and preferences. The measurement studies conducted in the paper indicate that more aligned models tend to perform better in terms of overall trustworthiness, but the effectiveness of alignment varies across the different trustworthiness categories considered.", "example": "For instance, an LLM could be evaluated based on the taxonomy provided in this paper. The model's outputs could be assessed for reliability, safety, fairness, resistance to misuse, explainability and reasoning, adherence to social norms, and robustness. Based on the evaluation, the model could then be fine-tuned to better align with human values and preferences."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper provides a comprehensive and detailed taxonomy for evaluating the alignment of LLMs, which is a significant contribution to the field.
