{"Published": "2022-02-07", "Title": "Cedille: A large autoregressive French language model", "Authors": "Martin M\u00fcller, Florian Laurent", "Summary": "Scaling up the size and training of autoregressive language models has enabled novel ways of solving Natural Language Processing tasks using zero-shot and few-shot learning. While extreme-scale language models such as GPT-3 offer multilingual capabilities, zero-shot learning for languages other than English remain largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Cedille, a large open source auto-regressive language model, specifically trained for the French language. Our results show that Cedille outperforms existing French language models and is competitive with GPT-3 on a range of French zero-shot benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth comparison of the toxicity exhibited by these models, showing that Cedille marks an improvement in language model safety thanks to dataset filtering.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Cedille: A Large Autoregressive Language Model Specifically Trained for French", "description": "The paper introduces Cedille, a large open-source autoregressive language model specifically trained for the French language. Cedille is built on GPT-J and is designed to outperform existing French language models and compete with GPT-3 on a range of French zero-shot benchmarks. The authors also provide an in-depth comparison of the toxicity exhibited by these models, showing that Cedille marks an improvement in language model safety thanks to dataset filtering. This work is a significant contribution to the field of language-specific LLMs, particularly for languages other than English."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Cedille offers improved performance and safety for French language tasks", "description": "For practitioners working with French language data, Cedille offers a powerful tool for a range of NLP tasks. Its competitive performance with GPT-3 and improved safety due to dataset filtering make it a compelling choice for applications such as translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. Furthermore, the open-source nature of Cedille allows for further fine-tuning and adaptation to specific tasks or domains.", "example": "For instance, a practitioner could use Cedille for a French customer service chatbot application. The model could be fine-tuned on specific customer service dialogues to improve its performance, while its built-in safety measures would help ensure appropriate responses."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel contribution in the form of Cedille, a large autoregressive language model specifically trained for French. While the concept of language-specific LLMs is not new, the scale of Cedille and its competitive performance with GPT-3 make it a significant advancement in the field.", "novelty_score": 2, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, discussing the training and evaluation of Cedille in detail. However, it does not delve into complex mathematical theories or algorithms, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents an interesting contribution to the field of language-specific LLMs. The comparison of Cedille with other models and the discussion of its safety measures make for an engaging read.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
