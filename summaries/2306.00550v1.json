{"Published": "2023-06-01", "Title": "Chain-Of-Thought Prompting Under Streaming Batch: A Case Study", "Authors": "Yuxin Tang", "Summary": "Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been proposed as a way of assisting LLMs in performing complex reasoning. However, developing effective prompts can be a challenging and labor-intensive task. Many studies come out of some way to automatically construct CoT from test data. Most of them assume that all test data is visible before testing and only select a small subset to generate rationales, which is an unrealistic assumption. In this paper, we present a case study on how to construct and optimize chain-of-thought prompting using batch data in streaming settings.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Optimizing Chain-of-Thought Prompting in Streaming Batch Data", "description": "The paper presents a case study on how to construct and optimize chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting using batch data in streaming settings. The authors address the problem of maintaining a coherent chain-of-thought within each batch in the stream, known as the intra-batch chain-of-thought. They propose an alternative approach to the simple concatenation function used in previous studies, which quickly reaches the maximum input sequence length of the Language Model and is not particularly scalable or efficient. The paper suggests the need for a prompting optimization function that can update the prompt before processing the next batch, thereby improving the efficiency and scalability of CoT prompting."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Efficient CoT Prompting in Streaming Settings Enhances LLM Performance", "description": "The study's findings can be applied to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming settings. By optimizing the chain-of-thought prompting process, practitioners can ensure that the model maintains a coherent chain-of-thought within each batch in the stream. This approach can potentially lead to more accurate and efficient results from the LLM. However, the paper does not provide a specific prompting optimization function, suggesting that further research is needed in this area.", "example": "For instance, in a streaming setting where an LLM is processing a continuous stream of questions, the model can use the optimized CoT prompting process to maintain a coherent chain-of-thought within each batch. This can potentially lead to more accurate answers and improved performance of the LLM."}, "category": "PROMPTING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper addresses a specific problem in the field of CoT prompting, namely the challenge of maintaining a coherent chain-of-thought within each batch in a streaming setting.
