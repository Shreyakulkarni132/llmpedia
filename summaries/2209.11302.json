To ameliorate that effort, large language models (LLMs) can be used to score potential next actions during task planning, and even generate action sequences directly, given an instruction in natural language with no additional domain information. However, such methods either require enumerating all possible next steps for scoring, or generate free-form text that may contain actions not possible on a given robot in its current context. We present a programmatic LLM prompt structure that enables plan generation functional across situated environments, robot capabilities, and tasks. Our key insight is to prompt the LLM with program-like specifications of the available actions and objects in an environment, as well as with example programs that can be executed. We make concrete recommendations about prompt structure and generation constraints through ablation experiments, demonstrate state of the art success rates in VirtualHome household tasks, and deploy our method on a physical robot arm for tabletop tasks.

The authors propose a programmatic LLM prompt structure that enables plan generation across different environments, robot capabilities, and tasks. The key innovation is to prompt the LLM with program-like specifications of the available actions and objects in an environment, along with example programs that can be executed. This method overcomes the limitations of previous methods that either required enumerating all possible next steps for scoring or generated free-form text that might contain unfeasible actions."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "PROGPROMPT offers a structured approach to task planning for robots using LLMs", "description": "PROGPROMPT provides a structured approach to task planning for robots using LLMs. It allows for the generation of action sequences directly from natural language instructions, without the need for additional domain information. This method can be particularly useful for AI practitioners working on robotics and automation, as it simplifies the task planning process and makes it more efficient. The approach can be applied to various environments and tasks, making it versatile and adaptable.", "example": "For instance, given a task 'Make dinner', the LLM can be prompted with program-like specifications of the available actions and objects in the kitchen environment, along with example programs that can be executed. The LLM then generates a sequence of actions like 'open the fridge', 'pick up the chicken', 'close the fridge', etc., which can be directly executed by the robot."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to task planning for robots using LLMs. The introduction of PROGPROMPT, which uses program-like specifications to prompt the LLM, is a significant advancement in the field.
