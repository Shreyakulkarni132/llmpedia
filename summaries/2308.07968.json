Most studies in this direction focus on a particular domain by designing bespoke features or models. In this work, we propose a general approach for personalized text generation using large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the practice of writing education, we develop a multistage and multitask framework to teach LLMs for personalized generation. In writing instruction, the task of writing from sources is often decomposed into multiple steps that involve finding, evaluating, summarizing, synthesizing, and integrating information. Analogously, our approach to personalized text generation consists of multiple stages: retrieval, ranking, summarization, synthesis, and generation. In addition, we introduce a multitask setting that helps the model improve its generation ability further, which is inspired by the observation in education that a student's reading proficiency and writing ability are often correlated. We evaluate our approach on three public datasets, each of which covers a different and representative domain. Our results show significant improvements over a variety of baselines.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Teaching LLMs to Personalize Text Generation", "description": "The paper presents a novel approach to personalized text generation using large language models (LLMs).

The multitask setting, in particular, can be used to improve the model's generation ability, which can be beneficial in tasks that require a high level of personalization. The approach can be implemented in various applications, such as AI-assisted writing, personal communications, and content transformation.", "example": "For instance, an LLM trained using this approach could be used to generate personalized emails or articles, taking into account the user's writing style and preferences. The model could first retrieve relevant information, rank it based on relevance, summarize the information, synthesize it, and finally generate the personalized text."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to personalized text generation using LLMs, drawing inspiration from the practice of writing education.
