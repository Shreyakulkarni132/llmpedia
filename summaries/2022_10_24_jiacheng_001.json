These knowledge-enhanced language models incorporate knowledge into pre-training to generate representations of entities or relationships. However, existing methods typically represent each entity with a separate embedding. As a result, these methods struggle to represent out-of-vocabulary entities and a large amount of parameters, on top of their underlying token models (i.e.,~the transformer), must be used and the number of entities that can be handled is limited in practice due to memory constraints. Moreover, existing models still struggle to represent entities and relationships simultaneously. To address these problems, we propose a new pre-trained model that learns representations of both entities and relationships from token spans and span pairs in the text respectively. By encoding spans efficiently with span modules, our model can represent both entities and their relationships but requires fewer parameters than existing models. We pre-trained our model with the knowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia and test it on a broad range of supervised and unsupervised information extraction tasks. Results show that our model learns better representations for both entities and relationships than baselines, while in supervised settings, fine-tuning our model outperforms RoBERTa consistently and achieves competitive results on information extraction tasks.", "main_contribution": "The paper introduces a new pre-trained model, SPOT, that learns representations of both entities and relationships from token spans and span pairs in the text. This model addresses the limitations of existing knowledge-enhanced language models, which struggle to represent out-of-vocabulary entities and require a large number of parameters. SPOT uses span modules to efficiently encode spans, requiring fewer parameters than existing models.", "takeaways": "SPOT's ability to represent both entities and their relationships with fewer parameters is a significant advantage. It can handle a larger number of entities, making it more practical for real-world applications. Furthermore, it outperforms RoBERTa in supervised settings and achieves competitive results on information extraction tasks, making it a promising tool for LLM practitioners.", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to knowledge-enhanced language representation by introducing a model that learns representations of both entities and relationships from token spans and span pairs.
