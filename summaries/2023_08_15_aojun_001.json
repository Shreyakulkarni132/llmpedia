In particular, OpenAI's latest version of GPT-4, known as GPT-4 Code Interpreter, shows remarkable performance on challenging math datasets. In this paper, we explore the effect of code on enhancing LLMs' reasoning capability by introducing different constraints on the \\textit{Code Usage Frequency} of GPT-4 Code Interpreter. We found that its success can be largely attributed to its powerful skills in generating and executing code, evaluating the output of code execution, and rectifying its solution when receiving unreasonable outputs. Based on this insight, we propose a novel and effective prompting method, explicit \\uline{c}ode-based \\uline{s}elf-\\uline{v}erification~(CSV), to further boost the mathematical reasoning potential of GPT-4 Code Interpreter. This method employs a zero-shot prompt on GPT-4 Code Interpreter to encourage it to use code to self-verify its answers. In instances where the verification state registers as ``False'', the model shall automatically amend its solution, analogous to our approach of rectifying errors during a mathematics examination. Furthermore, we recognize that the states of the verification result indicate the confidence of a solution, which can improve the effectiveness of majority voting. With GPT-4 Code Interpreter and CSV, we achieve an impressive zero-shot accuracy on MATH dataset \\textbf{(53.9\\% $\\to$ 84.3\\%)}.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Boosting Mathematical Reasoning of GPT-4 Code Interpreter with Code-based Self-Verification", "description": "The paper introduces a novel prompting method, Code-based Self-Verification (CSV), to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of GPT-4 Code Interpreter. The CSV method encourages the model to use code to self-verify its answers. If the verification state registers as 'False', the model automatically amends its solution, similar to how humans rectify errors during a mathematics examination. The authors also found that the states of the verification result can indicate the confidence of a solution, which can improve the effectiveness of majority voting. The application of CSV to GPT-4 Code Interpreter resulted in a significant improvement in zero-shot accuracy on the MATH dataset."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Code-based Self-Verification Enhances Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs", "description": "The CSV method can be used to improve the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly those that can generate and execute code.

The verification-guided weighted majority voting technique could also be used to improve the confidence in the model's solutions. The paper's findings suggest that the integration of code execution and self-verification in LLMs can lead to significant improvements in performance on challenging tasks.", "example": "For instance, when given a complex math problem, the GPT-4 Code Interpreter with CSV could generate a solution, verify it using code, and if the verification state is 'False', it could amend its solution and re-verify until the verification state is 'True'.
