{"Published": "2023-05-22", "Title": "LMGQS: A Large-scale Dataset for Query-focused Summarization", "Authors": "Ruochen Xu, Song Wang, Yang Liu, Shuohang Wang, Yichong Xu, Dan Iter, Chenguang Zhu, Michael Zeng", "Summary": "Query-focused summarization (QFS) aims to extract or generate a summary of an input document that directly answers or is relevant to a given query. The lack of large-scale datasets in the form of documents, queries, and summaries has hindered model development in this area. In contrast, multiple large-scale high-quality datasets for generic summarization exist. We hypothesize that there is a hidden query for each summary sentence in a generic summarization annotation, and we utilize a large-scale pretrained language model to recover it. In this way, we convert four generic summarization benchmarks into a new QFS benchmark dataset, LMGQS, which consists of over 1 million document-query-summary samples. We thoroughly investigate the properties of our proposed dataset and establish baselines with state-of-the-art summarization models. By fine-tuning a language model on LMGQS, we achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot and supervised performance on multiple existing QFS benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality and diversity of LMGQS.", "main_contribution": "The paper introduces a novel approach to create a large-scale dataset for Query-focused Summarization (QFS) by leveraging existing generic summarization datasets.

The approach of converting generic summarization datasets into QFS datasets is innovative and efficient, eliminating the need for time-consuming and expensive human annotation. The LMGQS dataset, with its high quality and diversity, has the potential to significantly advance research and model development in QFS.", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel method for creating a large-scale QFS dataset by converting existing generic summarization datasets.
