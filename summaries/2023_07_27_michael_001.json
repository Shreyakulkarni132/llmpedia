Medical generative vision-language models (VLMs) make a first step in this direction and promise many exciting clinical applications. However, existing models typically have to be fine-tuned on sizeable down-stream datasets, which poses a significant limitation as in many medical applications data is scarce, necessitating models that are capable of learning from few examples in real-time. Here we propose Med-Flamingo, a multimodal few-shot learner adapted to the medical domain. Based on OpenFlamingo-9B, we continue pre-training on paired and interleaved medical image-text data from publications and textbooks. Med-Flamingo unlocks few-shot generative medical visual question answering (VQA) abilities, which we evaluate on several datasets including a novel challenging open-ended VQA dataset of visual USMLE-style problems. Furthermore, we conduct the first human evaluation for generative medical VQA where physicians review the problems and blinded generations in an interactive app. Med-Flamingo improves performance in generative medical VQA by up to 20\\% in clinician's rating and firstly enables multimodal medical few-shot adaptations, such as rationale generation. We release our model, code, and evaluation app under https://github.com/snap-stanford/med-flamingo.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Med-Flamingo: A Multimodal Medical Few-Shot Learner for Real-Time Learning", "description": "The paper introduces Med-Flamingo, a multimodal few-shot learner specifically adapted for the medical domain. This model is based on OpenFlamingo-9B and is further pre-trained on paired and interleaved medical image-text data from publications and textbooks. Unlike existing models that require fine-tuning on large datasets, Med-Flamingo is designed to learn from few examples in real-time, addressing the data scarcity issue in many medical applications.
