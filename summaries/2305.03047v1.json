However, this dependence can significantly constrain the true potential of AI-assistant agents due to the high cost of obtaining human supervision and the related issues on quality, reliability, diversity, self-consistency, and undesirable biases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called SELF-ALIGN, which combines principle-driven reasoning and the generative power of LLMs for the self-alignment of AI agents with minimal human supervision. Our approach encompasses four stages: first, we use an LLM to generate synthetic prompts, and a topic-guided method to augment the prompt diversity; second, we use a small set of human-written principles for AI models to follow, and guide the LLM through in-context learning from demonstrations (of principles application) to produce helpful, ethical, and reliable responses to user's queries; third, we fine-tune the original LLM with the high-quality self-aligned responses so that the resulting model can generate desirable responses for each query directly without the principle set and the demonstrations anymore; and finally, we offer a refinement step to address the issues of overly-brief or indirect responses. Applying SELF-ALIGN to the LLaMA-65b base language model, we develop an AI assistant named Dromedary. With fewer than 300 lines of human annotations (including < 200 seed prompts, 16 generic principles, and 5 exemplars for in-context learning). Dromedary significantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including Text-Davinci-003 and Alpaca, on benchmark datasets with various settings.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "SELF-ALIGN: A novel approach for self-alignment of AI agents with minimal human supervision", "description": "The paper introduces SELF-ALIGN, a novel approach that combines principle-driven reasoning and the generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to align AI agents with human intentions with minimal human supervision.

The method's ability to generate synthetic prompts and guide the LLM through in-context learning from demonstrations can be particularly useful in developing AI assistants. The fine-tuning and refinement stages ensure the model can generate desirable responses directly, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the AI agent.", "example": "For instance, an AI practitioner could use SELF-ALIGN to develop an AI assistant. The practitioner would first use an LLM to generate synthetic prompts, then guide the LLM through in-context learning from demonstrations using a set of human-written principles. The LLM would then be fine-tuned with the self-aligned responses, and finally, the model would be refined to address overly-brief or indirect responses."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The SELF-ALIGN approach presents a novel way of aligning AI agents with human intentions with minimal human supervision.
