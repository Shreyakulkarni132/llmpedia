{"Published": "2019-04-16", "Title": "Explicit Motion Risk Representation", "Authors": "Xuesu Xiao, Jan Dufek, Robin Murphy", "Summary": "This paper presents a formal definition and explicit representation of robot motion risk. Currently, robot motion risk has not been formally defined, but has already been used in motion and path planning. Risk is either implicitly represented as model uncertainty using probabilistic approaches, where the definition of risk is somewhat avoided, or explicitly modeled as a simple function of states, without a formal definition. In this work, we provide formal reasoning behind what risk is for robot motion and propose a formal definition of risk in terms of a sequence of motion, namely path. Mathematical approaches to represent motion risk are also presented, which is in accordance with our risk definition and properties. The definition and representation of risk provide a meaningful way to evaluate or construct robot motion or path plans. The understanding of risk is even of greater interest for the search and rescue community: the deconstructed environments cast extra risk onto the robot, since they are working under extreme conditions. A proper risk representation has the potential to reduce robot failure in the field.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Formal Definition and Representation of Robot Motion Risk", "description": "The paper introduces a formal definition and explicit representation of robot motion risk, a concept previously used but not formally defined in the field of robotics. The authors propose a definition of risk in terms of a sequence of motion, or path, and present mathematical approaches to represent this motion risk. This formalization of risk provides a meaningful way to evaluate or construct robot motion or path plans, particularly in high-risk environments such as search and rescue operations. The proposed risk representation could potentially reduce robot failure in the field."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Formal Risk Representation Enhances Robot Motion Planning", "description": "The formal definition and representation of robot motion risk presented in this paper can be used to improve the safety and reliability of robot motion planning, particularly in high-risk environments. By quantifying risk in terms of a sequence of motion, it becomes possible to evaluate and compare different robot paths using the same metric. This could be particularly useful in the development of personal systems or products involving autonomous robots, where safety and reliability are paramount.", "example": "For instance, in a disaster response scenario, a robot could use this formal risk representation to evaluate different paths through a collapsed building. By choosing the path with the lowest risk, the robot could increase its chances of successfully completing its mission without failure."}, "category": "OTHER", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel contribution by formally defining and representing robot motion risk, a concept that has been used but not formally defined in the field of robotics.
