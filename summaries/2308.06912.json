{"Published": "2023-08-14", "Title": "CausalLM is not optimal for in-context learning", "Authors": "Nan Ding, Tomer Levinboim, Jialin Wu, Sebastian Goodman, Radu Soricut", "Summary": "Recent empirical evidence indicates that transformer based in-context learning performs better when using a prefix language model (prefixLM), in which in-context samples can all attend to each other, compared to causal language models (causalLM), which use auto-regressive attention that prohibits in-context samples to attend to future samples. While this result is intuitive, it is not understood from a theoretical perspective. In this paper we take a theoretical approach and analyze the convergence behavior of prefixLM and causalLM under a certain parameter construction. Our analysis shows that both LM types converge to their stationary points at a linear rate, but that while prefixLM converges to the optimal solution of linear regression, causalLM convergence dynamics follows that of an online gradient descent algorithm, which is not guaranteed to be optimal even as the number of samples grows infinitely. We supplement our theoretical claims with empirical experiments over synthetic and real tasks and using various types of transformers. Our experiments verify that causalLM consistently underperforms prefixLM in all settings.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Theoretical and Empirical Analysis of PrefixLM and CausalLM in In-Context Learning", "description": "The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the convergence behavior of prefix language models (prefixLM) and causal language models (causalLM) in the context of in-context learning (ICL).

This is due to prefixLM's ability to converge to the optimal solution of linear regression, unlike causalLM which follows the dynamics of an online gradient descent algorithm. This insight can guide practitioners in choosing the appropriate model for their specific tasks. For instance, when developing a system that relies heavily on in-context learning, such as a chatbot or a recommendation system, prefixLM would likely yield better results.", "example": "For instance, if you are developing a chatbot that uses in-context learning to generate responses, you might choose to use a prefixLM rather than a causalLM. This could be implemented as follows: \n\n\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt-2')\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('gpt-2')\n\n# Encode a list of in-context examples\ninput_ids = tokenizer.encode('Hello, how can I help you today?', return_tensors='pt')\n\n# Generate a response using the model\noutput = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1, no_repeat_ngram_size=2)\n\n# Decode the output\nresponse = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(response)\n\n\nThis code snippet shows how you might use a prefixLM to generate a response in a chatbot application."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper provides a novel theoretical analysis of the convergence behavior of prefixLM and causalLM in the context of in-context learning.

It requires a strong understanding of machine learning theory, particularly in the area of language models and in-context learning.

However, its highly technical nature and focus on theoretical aspects of language models may make it less enjoyable for readers who are more interested in practical applications or who do not have a strong background in machine learning theory.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
