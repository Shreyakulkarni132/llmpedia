{"Published": "2023-08-14", "Title": "Platypus: Quick, Cheap, and Powerful Refinement of LLMs", "Authors": "Ariel N. Lee, Cole J. Hunter, Nataniel Ruiz", "Summary": "We present $\\textbf{Platypus}$, a family of fine-tuned and merged Large Language Models (LLMs) that achieves the strongest performance and currently stands at first place in HuggingFace's Open LLM Leaderboard as of the release date of this work. In this work we describe (1) our curated dataset $\\textbf{Open-Platypus}$, that is a subset of other open datasets and which $\\textit{we release to the public}$ (2) our process of fine-tuning and merging LoRA modules in order to conserve the strong prior of pretrained LLMs, while bringing specific domain knowledge to the surface (3) our efforts in checking for test data leaks and contamination in the training data, which can inform future research. Specifically, the Platypus family achieves strong performance in quantitative LLM metrics across model sizes, topping the global Open LLM leaderboard while using just a fraction of the fine-tuning data and overall compute that are required for other state-of-the-art fine-tuned LLMs. In particular, a 13B Platypus model can be trained on $\\textit{a single}$ A100 GPU using 25k questions in 5 hours. This is a testament of the quality of our Open-Platypus dataset, and opens opportunities for more improvements in the field.

They also describe their process of fine-tuning and merging LoRA modules to conserve the strong prior of pretrained LLMs while bringing specific domain knowledge to the surface. The authors also discuss their efforts in checking for test data leaks and contamination in the training data. A notable achievement is that a 13B Platypus model can be trained on a single A100 GPU using 25k questions in just 5 hours, demonstrating the efficiency of their approach."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Efficient Fine-Tuning and Merging of LLMs Can Lead to Superior Performance", "description": "The Platypus approach demonstrates that efficient fine-tuning and merging of LLMs can lead to superior performance, even with a fraction of the fine-tuning data and overall compute required for other state-of-the-art fine-tuned LLMs. This opens up opportunities for more improvements in the field. The curated dataset, Open-Platypus, can be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working with LLMs. The process of checking for test data leaks and contamination in the training data can also inform future research and best practices in training LLMs.", "example": "For instance, a practitioner could use the Open-Platypus dataset and the fine-tuning and merging process described in the paper to train a new LLM for a specific task. The trained model could then be evaluated using the methods described in the paper to ensure its performance and check for any data leaks or contamination."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to fine-tuning and merging LLMs, which leads to superior performance with less data and compute resources. The introduction of the Open-Platypus dataset and the process of checking for test data leaks and contamination in the training data are also novel contributions.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, discussing the process of fine-tuning and merging LLMs, and the methods used to check for test data leaks and contamination in the training data. However, the concepts are explained clearly and should be accessible to readers with a background in AI and ML.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and organized, presenting a novel and intriguing contribution to the field of LLMs. The clear explanation of the methods and the presentation of the results make it an enjoyable read.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
