{"Published": "2023-08-02", "Title": "From Sparse to Soft Mixtures of Experts", "Authors": "Joan Puigcerver, Carlos Riquelme, Basil Mustafa, Neil Houlsby", "Summary": "Sparse mixture of expert architectures (MoEs) scale model capacity without large increases in training or inference costs. Despite their success, MoEs suffer from a number of issues: training instability, token dropping, inability to scale the number of experts, or ineffective finetuning. In this work, we proposeSoft MoE, a fully-differentiable sparse Transformer that addresses these challenges, while maintaining the benefits of MoEs. Soft MoE performs an implicit soft assignment by passing different weighted combinations of all input tokens to each expert. As in other MoE works, experts in Soft MoE only process a subset of the (combined) tokens, enabling larger model capacity at lower inference cost. In the context of visual recognition, Soft MoE greatly outperforms standard Transformers (ViTs) and popular MoE variants (Tokens Choice and Experts Choice). For example, Soft MoE-Base/16 requires 10.5x lower inference cost (5.7x lower wall-clock time) than ViT-Huge/14 while matching its performance after similar training. Soft MoE also scales well: Soft MoE Huge/14 with 128 experts in 16 MoE layers has over 40x more parameters than ViT Huge/14, while inference time cost grows by only 2%, and it performs substantially better.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Introduction of Soft MoE, a fully-differentiable sparse Transformer for improved model capacity and lower inference cost", "description": "The paper introduces Soft MoE, a novel approach to sparse mixture of expert architectures (MoEs) that addresses several challenges associated with traditional MoEs, such as training instability, token dropping, and inability to scale the number of experts. Unlike traditional MoEs that use a discrete optimization problem to assign tokens to experts, Soft MoE performs a soft assignment by passing different weighted combinations of all input tokens to each expert. This approach allows Soft MoE to maintain the benefits of MoEs, such as increased model capacity and lower inference cost, while avoiding the challenges associated with discrete token-to-expert assignments."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Soft MoE offers a scalable and efficient approach to model capacity expansion", "description": "The Soft MoE approach presents a promising alternative for scaling model capacity without significantly increasing training or inference costs. Its ability to perform soft assignments by passing different weighted combinations of all input tokens to each expert allows it to avoid the challenges associated with traditional MoEs, making it a more stable and scalable solution. This could be particularly useful in applications that require large model capacity but are constrained by computational resources.", "example": "For instance, in a large language model, Soft MoE could be used to increase the model's capacity by assigning different weighted combinations of input tokens to each expert.
