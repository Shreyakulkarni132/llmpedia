{"Published": "2023-06-15", "Title": "BLIP-2: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models", "Authors": "Junnan Li, Dongxu Li, Silvio Savarese, Steven Hoi", "Summary": "The cost of vision-and-language pre-training has become increasingly prohibitive due to end-to-end training of large-scale models. This paper proposes BLIP-2, a generic and efficient pre-training strategy that bootstraps vision-language pre-training from off-the-shelf frozen pre-trained image encoders and frozen large language models. BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying Transformer, which is pre-trained in two stages. The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters. We also demonstrate the model's emerging capabilities of zero-shot image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "BLIP-2: An efficient pre-training strategy for vision-language models", "description": "The paper introduces BLIP-2, a novel and efficient pre-training strategy for vision-language models.

The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder, while the second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model.

By leveraging pre-trained models and a two-stage bootstrapping process, BLIP-2 reduces the computational cost and complexity of the pre-training process. This approach can be particularly useful in scenarios where computational resources are limited, but high performance on vision-language tasks is required.", "example": "For instance, an LLM practitioner could use BLIP-2 to pre-train a model for a task like image captioning. The first stage would involve bootstrapping vision-language representation learning from a pre-trained image encoder, followed by bootstrapping vision-to-language generative learning from a pre-trained LLM in the second stage. This would result in a model capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant captions for images, while keeping the computational cost low."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "BLIP-2 introduces a novel approach to vision-language pre-training by leveraging pre-trained models and a two-stage bootstrapping process.
