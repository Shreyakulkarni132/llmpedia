Recent advances in language modelling and in neuroimaging methodology promise potential improvements in both the investigation of language's neurobiology and in the building of better and more human-like language models. This survey traces a line from early research linking Event Related Potentials and complexity measures derived from simple language models to contemporary studies employing Artificial Neural Network models trained on large corpora in combination with neural response recordings from multiple modalities using naturalistic stimuli.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Survey of research linking computational models and neural response measurements", "description": "This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the research that connects computational models, specifically Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, with neural response measurements. It traces the evolution of this field from early research that linked Event Related Potentials and complexity measures derived from simple language models to contemporary studies that employ ANNs trained on large corpora. The paper highlights the potential of these models in approximating human behavior on tasks such as object recognition, speech recognition, and various language understanding tasks, suggesting their potential as models for human cognition."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "ANN models can approximate human cognition and improve language models", "description": "For LLM practitioners, the paper underscores the potential of ANNs in approximating human cognition and improving language models. The research surveyed in the paper suggests that ANNs trained on large corpora can show considerable representational alignment to neural responses in the human brain. This insight could be leveraged to build more human-like language models and improve the performance of LLMs on various tasks.", "example": "For instance, an LLM practitioner could use the insights from this paper to guide the training of their models. By training their LLM on a large corpus and aligning it with neural responses, they could potentially improve the model's performance on language understanding tasks."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper does not introduce a new algorithm or technique, but rather provides a comprehensive survey of existing research in the field of computational models and neural response measurements.
