{"Published": "2023-05-29", "Title": "Code Prompting: a Neural Symbolic Method for Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models", "Authors": "Yi Hu, Haotong Yang, Zhouchen Lin, Muhan Zhang", "Summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have scaled up to unlock a wide range of complex reasoning tasks with the aid of various prompting methods. However, current prompting methods generate natural language intermediate steps to help reasoning, which can cause imperfect task reduction and confusion. To mitigate such limitations, we explore code prompting, a neural symbolic prompting method with both zero-shot and few-shot versions which triggers code as intermediate steps. We conduct experiments on 7 widely-used benchmarks involving symbolic reasoning and arithmetic reasoning. Code prompting generally outperforms chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. To further understand the performance and limitations of code prompting, we perform extensive ablation studies and error analyses, and identify several exclusive advantages of using symbolic promptings compared to natural language. We also consider the ensemble of code prompting and CoT prompting to combine the strengths of both. Finally, we show through experiments how code annotations and their locations affect code prompting.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Code Prompting: A Neural Symbolic Method for Complex Reasoning in LLMs", "description": "This paper introduces 'Code Prompting', a novel method that uses code as intermediate steps in Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance their reasoning capabilities.

By using code as intermediate steps, it reduces task reduction errors and confusion, often seen with natural language prompts. This method can be particularly useful in applications that require symbolic reasoning and arithmetic reasoning. Furthermore, the combination of Code Prompting and CoT prompting can leverage the strengths of both methods, potentially leading to even better performance.", "example": "For instance, in a task that requires the LLM to concatenate the last letters of given words, Code Prompting could generate Python code as an intermediate step: 'words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"elderberry\"]\nresult = \"\"\nfor word in words:\nresult += word[-1]\nprint(result)' This code-based intermediate step can help the LLM to better understand and complete the task."}, "category": "PROMPTING", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of Code Prompting as a new method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs is a significant contribution.
