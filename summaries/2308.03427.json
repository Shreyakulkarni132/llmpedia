Despite their prowess, the intrinsic generative abilities of LLMs may prove insufficient for handling complex tasks which necessitate a combination of task planning and the usage of external tools. In this paper, we first propose a structured framework tailored for LLM-based AI Agents and discuss the crucial capabilities necessary for tackling intricate problems. Within this framework, we design two distinct types of agents (i.e., one-step agent and sequential agent) to execute the inference process. Subsequently, we instantiate the framework using various LLMs and evaluate their Task Planning and Tool Usage (TPTU) abilities on typical tasks. By highlighting key findings and challenges, our goal is to provide a helpful resource for researchers and practitioners to leverage the power of LLMs in their AI applications. Our study emphasizes the substantial potential of these models, while also identifying areas that need more investigation and improvement.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "A Structured Framework for Evaluating Task Planning and Tool Usage Abilities of LLM-based AI Agents", "description": "The paper introduces a structured framework specifically designed for Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI Agents.

This can be particularly useful for AI practitioners who aim to integrate LLMs into complex systems that require task planning and tool usage. By using this framework, practitioners can identify the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs, and accordingly choose the most suitable one for their specific application. Furthermore, the framework can also guide the development of new LLMs with improved TPTU abilities.", "example": "For instance, if an AI practitioner is developing a system that requires complex task planning and tool usage, they can use the proposed framework to evaluate different LLMs. Based on the evaluation results, they can choose the LLM that performs best in terms of TPTU abilities, or they can use the insights gained from the evaluation to improve the TPTU abilities of their existing LLM."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel framework for evaluating the TPTU abilities of LLM-based AI Agents.
