Sainath, Eugene Weinstein, Bhuvana Ramabhadran, Yonghui Wu, Ankur Bapna, Zhifeng Chen, Seungji Lee", "Summary": "Multilingual end-to-end (E2E) models have shown great promise in expansion of automatic speech recognition (ASR) coverage of the world's languages. They have shown improvement over monolingual systems, and have simplified training and serving by eliminating language-specific acoustic, pronunciation, and language models. This work presents an E2E multilingual system which is equipped to operate in low-latency interactive applications, as well as handle a key challenge of real world data: the imbalance in training data across languages. Using nine Indic languages, we compare a variety of techniques, and find that a combination of conditioning on a language vector and training language-specific adapter layers produces the best model. The resulting E2E multilingual model achieves a lower word error rate (WER) than both monolingual E2E models (eight of nine languages) and monolingual conventional systems (all nine languages).", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Streaming E2E Multilingual System for Low-Latency ASR Applications", "description": "The paper presents a novel end-to-end (E2E) multilingual system designed to operate in low-latency interactive applications and handle the imbalance in training data across languages. The system uses a Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) to meet the latency constraints of interactive applications. The authors address the challenge of training the model with large-scale real-world data, which often has a significant skew in the distribution of speakers across languages. The best model was found to be a combination of conditioning on a language vector and training language-specific adapter layers. This E2E multilingual model outperforms both monolingual E2E models and conventional systems in terms of word error rate (WER)."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "E2E Multilingual System Enhances ASR Performance and Simplifies Training", "description": "The E2E multilingual system presented in this paper can be a game-changer for LLM practitioners working on automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. The system's ability to handle multiple languages with a single model simplifies the training process and eliminates the need for language-specific acoustic, pronunciation, and language models. Moreover, its low-latency operation makes it suitable for interactive applications. The approach of conditioning on a language vector and training language-specific adapter layers can be a useful technique for handling imbalanced training data across languages.", "example": "For instance, an LLM practitioner working on a multilingual voice assistant can use this E2E multilingual system to handle ASR for multiple languages.
