{"Published": "2023-05-29", "Title": "Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model", "Authors": "Rafael Rafailov, Archit Sharma, Eric Mitchell, Stefano Ermon, Christopher D. Manning, Chelsea Finn", "Summary": "While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) learn broad world knowledge and some reasoning skills, achieving precise control of their behavior is difficult due to the completely unsupervised nature of their training. Existing methods for gaining such steerability collect human labels of the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised LM to align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first fitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then fine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize this estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this paper, we leverage a mapping between reward functions and optimal policies to show that this constrained reward maximization problem can be optimized exactly with a single stage of policy training, essentially solving a classification problem on the human preference data. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need for fitting a reward model, sampling from the LM during fine-tuning, or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments show that DPO can fine-tune LMs to align with human preferences as well as or better than existing methods. Notably, fine-tuning with DPO exceeds RLHF's ability to control sentiment of generations and improves response quality in summarization and single-turn dialogue while being substantially simpler to implement and train.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Direct Preference Optimization: A Stable, Performant, and Lightweight Method for Fine-Tuning LMs", "description": "The paper introduces Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a novel method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to align with human preferences.

By directly optimizing a language model to adhere to human preferences, without explicit reward modeling or reinforcement learning, DPO simplifies the preference learning pipeline. This makes it a valuable tool for LLM practitioners looking to align model behavior with human preferences. Furthermore, DPO's stability and performance, coupled with its computational efficiency, make it a promising method for large-scale LLM applications.", "example": "For instance, if you're working on a sentiment analysis task, you can use DPO to fine-tune your LLM to align with human preferences. You would start by collecting a dataset of human preferences over model responses. Then, using DPO, you can optimize your LLM using a simple binary cross entropy objective, without explicitly learning a reward function or sampling from the policy during training. This results in a model that is better aligned with human sentiment preferences, improving the quality of your sentiment analysis."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) represents a significant advancement in the field of LLM fine-tuning.
