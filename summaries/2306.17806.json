In this work, we demonstrate that CFG can be used broadly as an inference-time technique in pure language modeling. We show that CFG (1) improves the performance of Pythia, GPT-2 and LLaMA-family models across an array of tasks: Q\\&A, reasoning, code generation, and machine translation, achieving SOTA on LAMBADA with LLaMA-7B over PaLM-540B; (2) brings improvements equivalent to a model with twice the parameter-count; (3) can stack alongside other inference-time methods like Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, yielding further improvements in difficult tasks; (4) can be used to increase the faithfulness and coherence of assistants in challenging form-driven and content-driven prompts: in a human evaluation we show a 75\\% preference for GPT4All using CFG over baseline.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) enhances performance of LLMs across various tasks", "description": "This paper demonstrates the broad applicability of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), an inference-time technique initially used in text-to-image generation, in pure language modeling.

Additionally, CFG can be used to increase the faithfulness and coherence of assistants in challenging prompts."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "CFG offers a lightweight technique to improve LLM performance and coherence", "description": "The use of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) can significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across a variety of tasks. It can be used to improve the performance of models without increasing their parameter count, making it a cost-effective solution. Furthermore, CFG can be used alongside other inference-time methods to yield further improvements. This technique can be particularly useful in applications where maintaining the coherence and faithfulness of the generated text is crucial.", "example": "For instance, in a chatbot application, CFG can be used to ensure that the responses generated by the LLM are coherent and adhere to the given prompt. This can improve the user experience by ensuring that the chatbot stays on topic and provides relevant responses."}, "category": "PROMPTING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper extends the application of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) from text-to-image generation to pure language modeling, demonstrating its effectiveness across a variety of tasks and models.
