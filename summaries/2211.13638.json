{"Published": "2022-11-24", "Title": "Prototypical Fine-tuning: Towards Robust Performance Under Varying Data Sizes", "Authors": "Yiqiao Jin, Xiting Wang, Yaru Hao, Yizhou Sun, Xing Xie", "Summary": "In this paper, we move towards combining large parametric models with non-parametric prototypical networks. We propose prototypical fine-tuning, a novel prototypical framework for fine-tuning pretrained language models (LM), which automatically learns a bias to improve predictive performance for varying data sizes, especially low-resource settings. Our prototypical fine-tuning approach can automatically adjust the model capacity according to the number of data points and the model's inherent attributes. Moreover, we propose four principles for effective prototype fine-tuning towards the optimal solution. Experimental results across various datasets show that our work achieves significant performance improvements under various low-resource settings, as well as comparable and usually better performances in high-resource scenarios.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Prototypical Fine-tuning: A novel framework for fine-tuning LMs with varying data sizes", "description": "The paper introduces Prototypical Fine-tuning (PFit), a new framework for fine-tuning pretrained language models (LMs) that can adapt to varying data sizes, especially in low-resource settings.

By automatically adjusting the model capacity based on the data and model attributes, PFit can potentially enhance the performance of LMs in a variety of applications. For LLM practitioners, this means improved model performance without the need for manual adjustments or extensive resources.", "example": "For instance, if an LLM practitioner is working with a small dataset for a specific task, they can use PFit to fine-tune their model. The PFit framework will automatically adjust the model's capacity to suit the size of the dataset, potentially improving the model's performance on the task."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to fine-tuning LMs, particularly in low-resource settings.
