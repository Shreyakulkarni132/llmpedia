{"Published": "2023-06-23", "Title": "Long-range Language Modeling with Self-retrieval", "Authors": "Ohad Rubin, Jonathan Berant", "Summary": "Retrieval-augmented language models (LMs) have received much attention recently. However, typically the retriever is not trained jointly as a native component of the LM, but added to an already-pretrained LM, which limits the ability of the LM and the retriever to adapt to one another. In this work, we propose the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT), an architecture and training procedure for jointly training a retrieval-augmented LM from scratch for the task of modeling long texts. Given a recently generated text chunk in a long document, the LM computes query representations, which are then used to retrieve earlier chunks in the document, located potentially tens of thousands of tokens before. Information from retrieved chunks is fused into the LM representations to predict the next target chunk. We train the retriever component with a semantic objective, where the goal is to retrieve chunks that increase the probability of the next chunk, according to a reference LM. We evaluate RPT on four long-range language modeling tasks, spanning books, code, and mathematical writing, and demonstrate that RPT improves retrieval quality and subsequently perplexity across the board compared to strong baselines.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer: Jointly Training a Retrieval-Augmented Language Model from Scratch", "description": "The paper introduces the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT), a novel architecture and training procedure for jointly training a retrieval-augmented language model (LM) from scratch.

By jointly training a retrieval-augmented language model from scratch, RPT can adaptively retrieve and fuse relevant information from earlier parts of a long document to predict future chunks. This approach can be particularly useful in applications that involve processing and understanding long texts, such as books, articles, code, scripts, and dialogue. For instance, in a book recommendation system, RPT could be used to understand the content of a book and generate a summary or review, even if the relevant information is scattered throughout the book.", "example": "For example, given a long document, RPT can be used to generate a summary as follows: \n\n\n# Initialize RPT model\nrpt = RetrievalPretrainedTransformer()\n\n# Load the long document\ndocument = load_document('document.txt')\n\n# Generate a summary\nsummary = rpt.generate_summary(document)\nprint(summary)\n\n\nThis code loads a long document, uses the RPT model to understand the content of the document, and generates a summary."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to long-range language modeling by introducing the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT). The RPT is unique in its joint training of a retrieval-augmented language model from scratch, which allows the model to adaptively retrieve and fuse relevant information from earlier parts of a long document. This represents a significant advancement in the field of language modeling.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is highly technical, delving into the architecture and training procedure of the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT). It discusses the computation of query representations, the retrieval of earlier chunks in a document, and the fusion of retrieved information into the language model representations. The paper also presents a detailed evaluation of the RPT on four long-range language modeling tasks.", "technical_score": 3, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and provides a comprehensive overview of the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT), making it an engaging read for those interested in language modeling. The detailed evaluation of the RPT on various tasks and the comparison with strong baselines provide valuable insights into the model's performance and potential applications.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
