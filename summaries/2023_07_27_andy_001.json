{"Published": "2023-07-27", "Title": "Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models", "Authors": "Andy Zou, Zifan Wang, J. Zico Kolter, Matt Fredrikson", "Summary": "Because \"out-of-the-box\" large language models are capable of generating a great deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these models in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been some success at circumventing these measures -- so-called \"jailbreaks\" against LLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method that causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors. Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range of queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of greedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past automatic prompt generation methods.   Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach are quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs. Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e., queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as multiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting attack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces to ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat, Pythia, Falcon, and others. In total, this work significantly advances the state-of-the-art in adversarial attacks against aligned language models, raising important questions about how such systems can be prevented from producing objectionable information.

The authors propose an approach that automatically generates adversarial suffixes to a wide range of queries, aiming to maximize the probability of the model producing an affirmative response to objectionable content. The method combines greedy and gradient-based search techniques to generate these adversarial suffixes. The generated adversarial prompts are found to be transferable across different models and can induce objectionable content in various public interfaces and open-source LLMs. The paper significantly advances the state-of-the-art in adversarial attacks against aligned LLMs, raising important questions about preventing such systems from producing objectionable information."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Adversarial Attacks on LLMs: A New Challenge for AI Safety", "description": "The paper's findings highlight a significant challenge in AI safety, demonstrating that adversarial attacks can be used to manipulate LLMs into generating harmful or objectionable content. The proposed method can be used to test the robustness of LLMs against adversarial attacks, helping to identify vulnerabilities and improve the alignment of these models. However, it also underscores the potential misuse of such techniques, emphasizing the need for rigorous defenses against adversarial attacks. The transferability of the adversarial prompts across different models suggests that a universal defense mechanism may be required to ensure the safety of LLMs.", "example": "For instance, an adversarial suffix can be appended to a seemingly harmless query like 'Tell me a story', transforming it into 'Tell me a story about how to commit a crime'. The LLM, manipulated by the adversarial suffix, might then generate a detailed plan for committing a crime, which is clearly undesirable and potentially harmful."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel method for generating universal and transferable adversarial attacks on aligned LLMs. While adversarial attacks on LLMs have been studied before, this work introduces a new approach that combines greedy and gradient-based search techniques to automatically generate adversarial suffixes. The transferability of these adversarial prompts across different models is a significant advancement in the field.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is highly technical, delving into the specifics of the proposed adversarial attack method, including the use of greedy and gradient-based search techniques. It requires a solid understanding of LLMs, adversarial attacks, and optimization techniques. The paper also includes a detailed analysis of the results, comparing the proposed method with previous approaches.", "technical_score": 3, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents a compelling narrative about the potential risks of LLMs and the need for robust defenses against adversarial attacks. The technical depth of the paper might make it a challenging read for those without a background in the field, but it provides valuable insights for those interested in AI safety and adversarial attacks on LLMs.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
