Intrinsically motivated exploration methods address this limitation by rewarding agents for visiting novel states or transitions, but these methods offer limited benefits in large environments where most discovered novelty is irrelevant for downstream tasks. We describe a method that uses background knowledge from text corpora to shape exploration. This method, called ELLM (Exploring with LLMs) rewards an agent for achieving goals suggested by a language model prompted with a description of the agent's current state. By leveraging large-scale language model pretraining, ELLM guides agents toward human-meaningful and plausibly useful behaviors without requiring a human in the loop. We evaluate ELLM in the Crafter game environment and the Housekeep robotic simulator, showing that ELLM-trained agents have better coverage of common-sense behaviors during pretraining and usually match or improve performance on a range of downstream tasks.", "main_contribution": "The paper introduces a novel method, ELLM (Exploring with LLMs), which uses large language models (LLMs) to guide reinforcement learning (RL) agents in their exploration. The LLM suggests goals based on the agent's current state, rewarding the agent for achieving these goals. This approach leverages the background knowledge from text corpora to shape exploration, guiding agents towards human-meaningful and potentially useful behaviors without requiring human intervention.", "takeaways": "The ELLM method provides a solution to the challenge of sparse reward functions in RL, offering a way to guide agents towards meaningful behaviors. This approach could be particularly beneficial in large environments where traditional intrinsically motivated exploration methods fall short. The practical implications for LLM practitioners include the potential to improve the performance of RL agents in various tasks and environments, as demonstrated in the Crafter game environment and the Housekeep robotic simulator.", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to guiding RL agents using LLMs. While RL and LLMs have been used together in previous works, the specific method of using LLMs to suggest goals based on the agent's current state and rewarding the agent for achieving these goals is a unique contribution.", "novelty_score": 3, "category": "TRAINING", "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, discussing the implementation of the ELLM method and its application in different environments. However, the concepts are explained in a clear manner, making it accessible to readers with a background in computer science or AI.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents an interesting and novel approach to a common problem in RL. The use of examples and clear explanations makes it enjoyable to read.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
