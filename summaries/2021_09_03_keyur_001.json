{"Published": "2021-09-03", "Title": "KI-BERT: Infusing Knowledge Context for Better Language and Domain Understanding", "Authors": "Keyur Faldu, Amit Sheth, Prashant Kikani, Hemang Akbari", "Summary": "Contextualized entity representations learned by state-of-the-art transformer-based language models (TLMs) like BERT, GPT, T5, etc., leverage the attention mechanism to learn the data context from training data corpus. However, these models do not use the knowledge context. Knowledge context can be understood as semantics about entities and their relationship with neighboring entities in knowledge graphs. We propose a novel and effective technique to infuse knowledge context from multiple knowledge graphs for conceptual and ambiguous entities into TLMs during fine-tuning. It projects knowledge graph embeddings in the homogeneous vector-space, introduces new token-types for entities, aligns entity position ids, and a selective attention mechanism. We take BERT as a baseline model and implement the \"Knowledge-Infused BERT\" by infusing knowledge context from ConceptNet and WordNet, which significantly outperforms BERT and other recent knowledge-aware BERT variants like ERNIE, SenseBERT, and BERT_CS over eight different subtasks of GLUE benchmark. The KI-BERT-base model even significantly outperforms BERT-large for domain-specific tasks like SciTail and academic subsets of QQP, QNLI, and MNLI.", "main_contribution": "The paper presents a novel technique to infuse knowledge context from multiple knowledge graphs into Transformer-based Language Models (TLMs) during fine-tuning. This technique projects knowledge graph embeddings into a homogeneous vector space, introduces new token types for entities, aligns entity position ids, and applies a selective attention mechanism. The authors implement this technique in a model they call 'Knowledge-Infused BERT' (KI-BERT), which uses knowledge context from ConceptNet and WordNet.", "takeaways": "The introduction of knowledge context into TLMs can significantly improve their performance, especially in domain-specific tasks. The KI-BERT model, which incorporates this technique, outperforms not only the baseline BERT model but also other knowledge-aware BERT variants and even BERT-large in certain tasks. This suggests that the infusion of knowledge context can enhance the capabilities of TLMs, making them more effective in understanding and processing language and domain-specific information.", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to infusing knowledge context from multiple knowledge graphs into TLMs during fine-tuning. This technique, and the resulting KI-BERT model, represent a significant advancement in the field, as they address a limitation of existing TLMs, which do not explicitly leverage knowledge context.", "novelty_score": 3, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "technical_analysis": "The paper is quite technical, introducing a new technique and implementing it in a new model. It requires a good understanding of TLMs, knowledge graphs, and the process of fine-tuning models.", "technical_score": 3, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents a novel and interesting contribution to the field. However, its highly technical content may make it challenging for non-experts to read and understand.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
