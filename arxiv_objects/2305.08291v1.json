The ToT technique is inspired by the human mind's\napproach for solving complex reasoning tasks through trial and error. In this\nprocess, the human mind explores the solution space through a tree-like thought\nprocess, allowing for backtracking when necessary. To implement ToT as a\nsoftware system, we augment an LLM with additional modules including a prompter\nagent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller. In order to\nsolve a given problem, these modules engage in a multi-round conversation with\nthe LLM. The memory module records the conversation and state history of the\nproblem solving process, which allows the system to backtrack to the previous\nsteps of the thought-process and explore other directions from there. To verify\nthe effectiveness of the proposed technique, we implemented a ToT-based solver\nfor the Sudoku Puzzle. Experimental results show that the ToT framework can\nsignificantly increase the success rate of Sudoku puzzle solving.
