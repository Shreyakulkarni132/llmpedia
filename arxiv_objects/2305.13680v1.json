Our evaluation involves analyzing ChatGPT-generated solutions\nfor 80 diverse programming exercises and comparing them to the correct\nsolutions. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT accurately generates Java\nprogramming solutions, which are characterized by high readability and\nwell-structured organization.
