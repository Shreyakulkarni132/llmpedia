Large language models can perform\nin-context learning, where they learn a new task from a few task\ndemonstrations, without any parameter updates. This work examines the\nimplications of in-context learning for the creation of datasets for new\nnatural language tasks. Departing from recent in-context learning methods, we\nformulate an annotation-efficient, two-step framework: selective annotation\nthat chooses a pool of examples to annotate from unlabeled data in advance,\nfollowed by prompt retrieval that retrieves task examples from the annotated\npool at test time. Based on this framework, we propose an unsupervised,\ngraph-based selective annotation method, voke-k, to select diverse,\nrepresentative examples to annotate. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets\n(covering classification, commonsense reasoning, dialogue, and text/code\ngeneration) demonstrate that our selective annotation method improves the task\nperformance by a large margin. On average, vote-k achieves a 12.9%/11.4%\nrelative gain under an annotation budget of 18/100, as compared to randomly\nselecting examples to annotate. Compared to state-of-the-art supervised\nfinetuning approaches, it yields similar performance with 10-100x less\nannotation cost across 10 tasks. We further analyze the effectiveness of our\nframework in various scenarios: language models with varying sizes, alternative\nselective annotation methods, and cases where there is a test data domain\nshift.
