QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models).
