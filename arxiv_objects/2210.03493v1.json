Providing these steps for prompting\ndemonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. CoT prompting has\ntwo major paradigms. One leverages a simple prompt like \"Let's think step by\nstep\" to facilitate step-by-step thinking before answering a question. The\nother uses a few manual demonstrations one by one, each composed of a question\nand a reasoning chain that leads to an answer.
