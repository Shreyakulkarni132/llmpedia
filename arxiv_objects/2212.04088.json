The high data cost and poor\nsample efficiency of existing methods hinders the development of versatile\nagents that are capable of many tasks and can learn new tasks quickly. In this\nwork, we propose a novel method, LLM-Planner, that harnesses the power of large\nlanguage models to do few-shot planning for embodied agents. We further propose\na simple but effective way to enhance LLMs with physical grounding to generate\nand update plans that are grounded in the current environment. Experiments on\nthe ALFRED dataset show that our method can achieve very competitive few-shot\nperformance: Despite using less than 0.5% of paired training data, LLM-Planner\nachieves competitive performance with recent baselines that are trained using\nthe full training data. Existing methods can barely complete any task\nsuccessfully under the same few-shot setting.
