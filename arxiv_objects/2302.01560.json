To this end, we propose \"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select\"\n(DEPS), an interactive planning approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs).\nOur approach helps with better error correction from the feedback during the\nlong-haul planning, while also bringing the sense of proximity via goal\nSelector, a learnable module that ranks parallel sub-goals based on the\nestimated steps of completion and improves the original plan accordingly. Our\nexperiments mark the milestone of the first multi-task agent that can robustly\naccomplish 70+ Minecraft tasks and nearly doubles the overall performances.\nFinally, the ablation and exploratory studies detail how our design beats the\ncounterparts and provide a promising update on the $\\texttt{ObtainDiamond}$\ngrand challenge with our approach.
