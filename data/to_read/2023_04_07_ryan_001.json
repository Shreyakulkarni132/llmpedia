{"Published": "2023-04-07", "Title": "Attention: Marginal Probability is All You Need?", "Authors": "Ryan Singh, Christopher L. Buckley", "Summary": "Attention mechanisms are a central property of cognitive systems allowing them to selectively deploy cognitive resources in a flexible manner. Attention has been long studied in the neurosciences and there are numerous phenomenological models that try to capture its core properties. Recently attentional mechanisms have become a dominating architectural choice of machine learning and are the central innovation of Transformers. The dominant intuition and formalism underlying their development has drawn on ideas of keys and queries in database management systems. In this work, we propose an alternative Bayesian foundation for attentional mechanisms and show how this unifies different attentional architectures in machine learning. This formulation allows to to identify commonality across different attention ML architectures as well as suggest a bridge to those developed in neuroscience. We hope this work will guide more sophisticated intuitions into the key properties of attention architectures and suggest new ones.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Bayesian Foundation for Attention Mechanisms in Machine Learning", "description": "The paper proposes a Bayesian foundation for attention mechanisms in machine learning, providing a unified perspective on different attention architectures. The authors argue that 'soft' attention mechanisms, such as self-attention, cross-attention, and graph attention, can be understood probabilistically as taking an expectation over possible connectivity structures. This links softmax-based attention to marginal likelihood. The authors also extend the uncertainty over connectivity to a Bayesian setting, providing a theoretical grounding for iterative attention mechanisms like slot-attention, perceiver, and block-slot attention. This new perspective could guide the development of more sophisticated attention architectures and bridge the gap between machine learning and neuroscience."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Bayesian Perspective Enhances Understanding of Attention Mechanisms", "description": "The Bayesian perspective on attention mechanisms presented in this paper can enhance our understanding of these mechanisms and their role in machine learning. This could lead to the development of more sophisticated attention architectures and improve the performance of models that use these architectures. For example, understanding attention mechanisms as taking an expectation over possible connectivity structures could help in designing more efficient and effective attention mechanisms. This could be particularly useful in tasks that require the model to focus on specific parts of the input, such as text summarization or image segmentation.", "example": "For instance, in a text summarization task, understanding the attention mechanism as a probabilistic expectation over possible connectivity structures could help in designing a model that focuses more on the most important parts of the text, leading to more accurate and concise summaries."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel Bayesian perspective on attention mechanisms in machine learning, providing a unified view of different attention architectures.
