In this work, we explore how conformal prediction can be used to provide uncertainty quantification in language models for the specific task of multiple-choice question-answering. We find that the uncertainty estimates from conformal prediction are tightly correlated with prediction accuracy. This observation can be useful for downstream applications such as selective classification and filtering out low-quality predictions. We also investigate the exchangeability assumption required by conformal prediction to out-of-subject questions, which may be a more realistic scenario for many practical applications. Our work contributes towards more trustworthy and reliable usage of large language models in safety-critical situations, where robust guarantees of error rate are required.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Conformal Prediction for Uncertainty Quantification in LLMs for MCQA", "description": "The paper introduces the use of conformal prediction, a distribution-free uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework, for large language models (LLMs) in the context of multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA).

This can be beneficial in applications where it's crucial to have a robust measure of prediction accuracy, such as in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law. The correlation between uncertainty estimates and prediction accuracy can be leveraged to filter out low-quality predictions, thereby improving the overall quality of the system's outputs. Furthermore, the exploration of the exchangeability assumption provides insights into the performance of conformal prediction in more realistic scenarios.", "example": "For instance, in a healthcare application where an LLM is used to answer multiple-choice questions about a patient's symptoms, conformal prediction could be used to quantify the uncertainty of the model's predictions. If the uncertainty is high, the prediction could be flagged for review by a human expert, thereby reducing the risk of incorrect decisions being made based on the model's output."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The application of conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification in LLMs, specifically for MCQA tasks, is a novel contribution.
