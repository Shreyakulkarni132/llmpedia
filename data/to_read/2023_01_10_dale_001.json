{"Published": "2023-01-10", "Title": "Memory Augmented Large Language Models are Computationally Universal", "Authors": "Dale Schuurmans", "Summary": "We show that transformer-based large language models are computationally universal when augmented with an external memory. Any deterministic language model that conditions on strings of bounded length is equivalent to a finite automaton, hence computationally limited. However, augmenting such models with a read-write memory creates the possibility of processing arbitrarily large inputs and, potentially, simulating any algorithm. We establish that an existing large language model, Flan-U-PaLM 540B, can be combined with an associative read-write memory to exactly simulate the execution of a universal Turing machine, $U_{15,2}$. A key aspect of the finding is that it does not require any modification of the language model weights. Instead, the construction relies solely on designing a form of stored instruction computer that can subsequently be programmed with a specific set of prompts.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Large Language Models Augmented with External Memory are Computationally Universal", "description": "The paper demonstrates that transformer-based large language models (LLMs), when augmented with an external memory, can simulate any algorithm, thus becoming computationally universal.

This opens up a wide range of possibilities for the application of LLMs in various fields, from natural language processing to complex problem-solving. The fact that this can be achieved without modifying the language model weights, but by simply designing a form of stored instruction computer, makes it a practical and efficient approach.", "example": "Consider a scenario where an LLM is used to process large volumes of text data. By augmenting the LLM with an external memory, it can be programmed to perform complex tasks such as summarizing the entire data, identifying patterns, or even generating new text based on the patterns identified. This can be achieved by designing a set of prompts that guide the LLM to perform these tasks."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to enhancing the computational capabilities of LLMs by augmenting them with an external memory.
