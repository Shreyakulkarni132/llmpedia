Guided by ImageBind, we construct a joint embedding space between 3D and multi-modalities, enabling many promising applications, e.g., any-to-3D generation, 3D embedding arithmetic, and 3D open-world understanding. On top of this, we further present Point-LLM, the first 3D large language model (LLM) following 3D multi-modal instructions. By parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, Point-LLM injects the semantics of Point-Bind into pre-trained LLMs, e.g., LLaMA, which requires no 3D instruction data, but exhibits superior 3D and multi-modal question-answering capacity. We hope our work may cast a light on the community for extending 3D point clouds to multi-modality applications.

They can be used to create 3D models from multi-modal inputs, perform arithmetic operations in the 3D embedding space, and understand 3D environments in an open-world context. The models can also answer questions about 3D and multi-modal data. These capabilities could be used in a variety of applications, such as autonomous driving, navigation, 3D scene understanding, and robotics.", "example": "For instance, Point-Bind could take as input a 2D image of a car, a textual description of the car, and audio of the car's engine, and generate a 3D model of the car. Point-LLM could then be used to answer questions about the car, such as 'What is the make and model of the car?' or 'What is the car's top speed?'"}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to aligning 3D point clouds with multi-modal data and the first 3D large language model that follows 3D multi-modal instructions.
