{"Published": "2022-12-31", "Title": "Rethinking with Retrieval: Faithful Large Language Model Inference", "Authors": "Hangfeng He, Hongming Zhang, Dan Roth", "Summary": "Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the stored knowledge in these models may inevitably be incomplete, out-of-date, or incorrect. This motivates the need to utilize external knowledge to assist LLMs. Unfortunately, current methods for incorporating external knowledge often require additional training or fine-tuning, which can be costly and may not be feasible for LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel post-processing approach, rethinking with retrieval (RR), which retrieves relevant external knowledge based on the decomposed reasoning steps obtained from the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. This lightweight approach does not require additional training or fine-tuning and is not limited by the input length of LLMs. We evaluate the effectiveness of RR through extensive experiments with GPT-3 on three complex reasoning tasks: commonsense reasoning, temporal reasoning, and tabular reasoning. Our results show that RR can produce more faithful explanations and improve the performance of LLMs.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Rethinking with Retrieval: A Novel Post-Processing Approach for LLMs", "description": "The paper introduces a novel post-processing approach, Rethinking with Retrieval (RR), to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs).

By retrieving relevant external knowledge based on decomposed reasoning steps, RR can produce more faithful explanations and improve the accuracy of LLMs. This approach can be particularly useful in complex reasoning tasks, such as commonsense reasoning, temporal reasoning, and tabular reasoning.", "example": "For instance, given a complex reasoning task such as 'Did Aristotle use a laptop?', RR would use CoT prompting to generate a reasoning path like 'Aristotle died in 322 BC. The first laptop was invented in 1980. Thus, Aristotle did not use a laptop. So the answer is no.' RR would then retrieve relevant external knowledge to support this reasoning path, leading to a more faithful explanation and improved prediction."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of the Rethinking with Retrieval (RR) approach is a novel contribution to the field of LLMs. While the use of external knowledge to enhance LLMs is not new, the RR approach is unique in its post-processing application, which does not require additional training or fine-tuning. This makes RR a cost-effective and practical solution for improving the performance of LLMs.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it delves into the specifics of the RR approach and its application in LLMs. It discusses the use of chain-of-thought prompting, the retrieval of relevant external knowledge, and the evaluation of the effectiveness of RR through experiments. However, the concepts are explained clearly and comprehensively, making the paper accessible to readers with a basic understanding of LLMs.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents a novel approach to enhancing the performance of LLMs. The clear explanation of the RR approach and the detailed presentation of the experimental results make the paper an engaging read. The practical implications of the RR approach for LLM practitioners add to the paper's appeal.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
