We propose a simple algorithm for aligning LLMs with human preferences inspired by growing batch reinforcement learning (RL), which we call Reinforced Self-Training (ReST). Given an initial LLM policy, ReST produces a dataset by generating samples from the policy, which are then used to improve the LLM policy using offline RL algorithms. ReST is more efficient than typical online RLHF methods because the training dataset is produced offline, which allows data reuse. While ReST is a general approach applicable to all generative learning settings, we focus on its application to machine translation. Our results show that ReST can substantially improve translation quality, as measured by automated metrics and human evaluation on machine translation benchmarks in a compute and sample-efficient manner.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) for Efficient Large Language Model Training", "description": "The paper introduces Reinforced Self-Training (ReST), an algorithm for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences.

By generating a dataset from an initial LLM policy and then using this dataset to improve the policy using offline RL algorithms, ReST allows for data reuse and reduces computational cost. This approach could be applied to other generative learning settings, potentially improving the performance of LLMs in a variety of tasks.", "example": "For instance, an initial LLM policy could be trained to generate translations from English to French. ReST would then generate a dataset from this policy, which could be used to fine-tune the policy using offline RL algorithms. This process could be repeated until the desired level of translation quality is achieved."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of the ReST algorithm represents a significant contribution to the field of LLM training. While the concept of aligning LLMs with human preferences is not new, the use of offline RL algorithms to improve an LLM policy based on a dataset generated from the policy itself is a novel approach.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it delves into the specifics of the ReST algorithm and its implementation. However, the authors do a good job of explaining the concepts in a clear and understandable manner, making the paper accessible to readers with a basic understanding of LLMs and reinforcement learning.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and organized, presenting a novel and intriguing contribution to the field of LLM training.
