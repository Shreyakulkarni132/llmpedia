Arik, Tomas Pfister", "Summary": "A hallmark of modern large language models (LLMs) is their impressive general zero-shot and few-shot abilities, often elicited through prompt-based and/or in-context learning. However, while highly coveted and being the most general, zero-shot performances in LLMs are still typically weaker due to the lack of guidance and the difficulty of applying existing automatic prompt design methods in general tasks when ground-truth labels are unavailable. In this study, we address this by presenting Universal Self-adaptive Prompting (USP), an automatic prompt design approach specifically tailored for zero-shot learning (while compatible with few-shot). Requiring only a small amount of unlabeled data & an inference-only LLM, USP is highly versatile: to achieve universal prompting, USP categorizes a possible NLP task into one of the three possible task types, and then uses a corresponding selector to select the most suitable queries & zero-shot model-generated responses as pseudo-demonstrations, thereby generalizing ICL to the zero-shot setup in a fully automated way. We evaluate zero-shot USP with two PaLM models, and demonstrate performances that are considerably stronger than standard zero-shot baselines and are comparable to or even superior than few-shot baselines across more than 20 natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Universal Self-adaptive Prompting (USP) for Enhanced Zero-shot Learning in LLMs", "description": "The paper introduces Universal Self-adaptive Prompting (USP), a novel automatic prompt design approach tailored for zero-shot learning in Large Language Models (LLMs).

By categorizing tasks and selecting suitable queries and responses, USP can improve the performance of LLMs even when ground-truth labels are unavailable. This could be particularly useful in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. The approach is compatible with existing LLMs and can be integrated into existing workflows to improve performance.", "example": "For instance, an LLM equipped with USP could be used to analyze customer feedback in a zero-shot manner. Given a set of customer reviews, the LLM could categorize the task (e.g., sentiment analysis), select suitable queries (e.g., 'Is this review positive or negative?'), and generate responses based on the review text, providing valuable insights without the need for labeled training data."}, "category": "PROMPTING", "novelty_analysis": "The Universal Self-adaptive Prompting (USP) approach is a novel contribution to the field of LLMs, addressing the challenge of zero-shot learning in a unique and effective way.
