Though, most of the works focus on vision-language multi-modal models providing strong capabilities in following vision-and-language instructions. However, we claim that speech is also an important modality through which humans interact with the world. Hence, it is crucial for a general-purpose assistant to be able to follow multi-modal speech-and-language instructions. In this work, we propose Large Language and Speech Model (LLaSM). LLaSM is an end-to-end trained large multi-modal speech-language model with cross-modal conversational abilities, capable of following speech-and-language instructions. Our early experiments show that LLaSM demonstrates a more convenient and natural way for humans to interact with artificial intelligence. Specifically, we also release a large Speech Instruction Following dataset LLaSM-Audio-Instructions. Code and demo are available at https://github.com/LinkSoul-AI/LLaSM and https://huggingface.co/spaces/LinkSoul/LLaSM. The LLaSM-Audio-Instructions dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LinkSoul/LLaSM-Audio-Instructions.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "LLaSM: A Large Language and Speech Model for Multi-modal Conversational Abilities", "description": "The paper introduces the Large Language and Speech Model (LLaSM), a multi-modal speech-language model with cross-modal conversational abilities. The authors argue that while most large language models focus on text input or vision-language multi-modal models, speech is an equally important modality for human interaction. LLaSM is designed to understand and follow speech-and-language instructions, providing a more natural way for humans to interact with artificial intelligence. The model uses a speech encoder to convert speech signals into embeddings, which are then aligned with text embeddings using a modal adaptor. The training process is divided into two stages: modality adaptation pre-training and cross-modal instruction fine-tuning. The authors also release a large Speech Instruction Following dataset, LLaSM-Audio-Instructions, to support the model's training."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "LLaSM Offers a More Natural Interaction with AI Through Speech", "description": "LLaSM's ability to understand and follow speech-and-language instructions opens up new possibilities for more natural and convenient human-AI interactions. This could be particularly useful in applications such as voice assistants, customer service bots, and other conversational AI systems. The model's training process, which involves modality adaptation pre-training and cross-modal instruction fine-tuning, could also serve as a blueprint for developing other multi-modal models. The LLaSM-Audio-Instructions dataset, which is the largest of its kind, provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating similar models.", "example": "For instance, a voice assistant powered by LLaSM could understand and respond to complex speech-and-language instructions, such as 'Find me a recipe for spaghetti bolognese and read out the ingredients and steps.' The assistant could then search for the recipe, convert the text into speech, and read it out to the user."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of LLaSM represents a significant advancement in the field of multi-modal large language models. While previous models have focused on text input or vision-language multi-modalities, LLaSM is one of the first to incorporate speech as a key modality. The model's training process, which involves modality adaptation pre-training and cross-modal instruction fine-tuning, is also a novel approach. The release of the LLaSM-Audio-Instructions dataset, the largest of its kind, further contributes to the novelty of this work.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, detailing the architecture of the LLaSM model, its training process, and the construction of the LLaSM-Audio-Instructions dataset. However, the authors explain these concepts clearly and provide ample context, making the paper accessible to readers with a basic understanding of large language models and multi-modal learning.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it an enjoyable read. The authors' argument for the importance of speech as a modality in large language models is compelling, and the introduction of LLaSM and the LLaSM-Audio-Instructions dataset adds to the intrigue. The paper also includes a demo and code, which provide practical insights into the model's capabilities.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
