Fu, Tri Dao, Stephen Baccus, Yoshua Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R\u00e9", "Summary": "Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Hyena: A Subquadratic Drop-In Replacement for Attention in Large Language Models", "description": "The paper introduces Hyena, a subquadratic operator designed to replace the attention mechanism in Large Language Models (LLMs).

Its ability to match the performance of attention-based models while reducing computational requirements could lead to more efficient training of LLMs. Furthermore, Hyena's design allows it to be used as a drop-in replacement for attention, making it easy to integrate into existing models. For practitioners working with LLMs, Hyena could offer a way to improve model performance while reducing computational costs.", "example": "For instance, in a task involving the generation of long-form text, a model using Hyena could potentially handle longer sequences more efficiently than a model using the traditional attention mechanism. This could lead to improved performance in tasks such as document summarization, translation of long texts, or generation of long-form creative writing."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "Hyena introduces a novel approach to handling long sequences in LLMs, offering a subquadratic alternative to the attention mechanism. While other subquadratic methods exist, Hyena stands out for its ability to match the performance of attention-based models while reducing computational requirements. This represents a significant contribution to the field of LLMs.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is highly technical, delving into the specifics of the Hyena operator and providing a detailed comparison with the attention mechanism. It requires a solid understanding of LLMs, the attention mechanism, and related concepts such as convolutions and gating. The paper also includes a detailed mathematical analysis of the Hyena operator.", "technical_score": 3, "enjoyable_analysis": "For readers with a strong background in LLMs and a deep understanding of the attention mechanism, this paper offers an engaging exploration of a novel approach to handling long sequences. The clear presentation of the Hyena operator and the detailed comparison with the attention mechanism provide valuable insights. However, the high level of technical detail may make the paper challenging for less experienced readers.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
