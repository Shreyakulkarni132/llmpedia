However, existing CoT studies have focused on the language modality. We propose Multimodal-CoT that incorporates language (text) and vision (images) modalities into a two-stage framework that separates rationale generation and answer inference. In this way, answer inference can leverage better generated rationales that are based on multimodal information. With Multimodal-CoT, our model under 1 billion parameters outperforms the previous state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-3.5) by 16 percentage points (75.17%->91.68% accuracy) on the ScienceQA benchmark and even surpasses human performance. Code is publicly available available at https://github.com/amazon-science/mm-cot.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Enhances LLM Performance", "description": "The paper introduces Multimodal-CoT, a novel approach that incorporates both language (text) and vision (images) modalities into a two-stage framework for Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework separates rationale generation and answer inference, allowing the latter to leverage better generated rationales based on multimodal information. The authors demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of LLMs, with their model under 1 billion parameters outperforming the previous state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-3.5) by 16 percentage points on the ScienceQA benchmark. This work is the first to study Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in different modalities, and the authors show that their method even surpasses human performance on the benchmark."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Multimodal-CoT Offers Enhanced Reasoning Capabilities for LLMs", "description": "The Multimodal-CoT approach can be used to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in tasks that require understanding and integrating information from multiple modalities. This could be particularly useful in applications such as visual question answering, where the model needs to understand both text and image inputs to generate accurate responses. The two-stage framework, which separates rationale generation and answer inference, could also be applied to other tasks to improve the quality of the generated rationales and the accuracy of the final answers.", "example": "For instance, in a visual question answering task, the input could be a question about an image, such as 'What color is the cat in the image?'. The Multimodal-CoT model would first generate a rationale based on both the text and image inputs, such as 'The cat in the image appears to be orange.', and then use this rationale to infer the final answer, 'The cat is orange.'."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating both language and vision modalities into a two-stage framework.

However, the authors do a good job of explaining the concepts and methods in a clear and understandable manner, making the paper accessible to readers with a basic understanding of LLMs and machine learning.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and organized, presenting a novel and intriguing contribution to the field of LLMs. The authors provide clear explanations of their methods and results, making the paper an engaging and informative read for those interested in the development and application of LLMs.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
