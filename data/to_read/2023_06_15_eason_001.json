{"Published": "2023-06-15", "Title": "GPTutor: a ChatGPT-powered programming tool for code explanation", "Authors": "Eason Chen, Ray Huang, Han-Shin Chen, Yuen-Hsien Tseng, Liang-Yi Li", "Summary": "Learning new programming skills requires tailored guidance. With the emergence of advanced Natural Language Generation models like the ChatGPT API, there is now a possibility of creating a convenient and personalized tutoring system with AI for computer science education. This paper presents GPTutor, a ChatGPT-powered programming tool, which is a Visual Studio Code extension using the ChatGPT API to provide programming code explanations. By integrating Visual Studio Code API, GPTutor can comprehensively analyze the provided code by referencing the relevant source codes. As a result, GPTutor can use designed prompts to explain the selected code with a pop-up message. GPTutor is now published at the Visual Studio Code Extension Marketplace, and its source code is openly accessible on GitHub. Preliminary evaluation indicates that GPTutor delivers the most concise and accurate explanations compared to vanilla ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. Moreover, the feedback from students and teachers indicated that GPTutor is user-friendly and can explain given codes satisfactorily. Finally, we discuss possible future research directions for GPTutor. This includes enhancing its performance and personalization via further prompt programming, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of GPTutor with real users.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "GPTutor: A ChatGPT-Powered Programming Tool for Code Explanation", "description": "The paper introduces GPTutor, a Visual Studio Code extension that leverages the ChatGPT API to provide detailed explanations of programming code.
