{"Published": "2023-05-23", "Title": "Baize: An Open-Source Chat Model with Parameter-Efficient Tuning on Self-Chat Data", "Authors": "Canwen Xu, Daya Guo, Nan Duan, Julian McAuley", "Summary": "Chat models, such as ChatGPT, have shown impressive capabilities and have been rapidly adopted across numerous domains. However, these models are only accessible through a restricted API, creating barriers for new research and progress in the field. We propose a pipeline that can automatically generate a high-quality multi-turn chat corpus by leveraging ChatGPT to engage in a conversation with itself. Subsequently, we employ parameter-efficient tuning to enhance LLaMA, an open-source large language model. The resulting model, named Baize, demonstrates good performance in multi-turn dialogues with guardrails that minimize potential risks. Furthermore, we propose a new technique called Self-Distill with Feedback, to further improve the performance of the Baize models with feedback from ChatGPT. The Baize models and data are released for research purposes only at https://github.com/project-baize/baize-chatbot. An online demo is also available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/project-baize/chat-with-baize.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Baize: An Open-Source Chat Model with Parameter-Efficient Tuning on Self-Chat Data", "description": "The paper introduces Baize, an open-source chat model that leverages the capabilities of ChatGPT to automatically generate a high-quality multi-turn chat corpus. The authors propose a novel pipeline where ChatGPT engages in a conversation with itself, simulating both user and AI responses. This generated corpus serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating chat models in the context of multi-turn dialogues. The authors also employ parameter-efficient tuning to enhance LLaMA, an open-source large language model. Furthermore, they propose a new technique called Self-Distill with Feedback (SDF), to further improve the performance of the Baize models with feedback from ChatGPT."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Baize: A New Open-Source Chat Model with Enhanced Performance", "description": "Baize, the open-source chat model introduced in this paper, can be a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners working with large language models. The model demonstrates good performance in multi-turn dialogues and can be fine-tuned to be specialized in specific areas, such as healthcare or finance. The authors also propose a new technique, Self-Distill with Feedback (SDF), which can be used to further improve the performance of the Baize models. This technique can be particularly useful for those looking to enhance the performance of their models with feedback from ChatGPT.", "example": "For instance, if you are working on a chatbot for customer support in the healthcare industry, you can use the Baize model and fine-tune it using the proposed pipeline. You can then use the SDF technique to further improve the performance of your chatbot with feedback from ChatGPT."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to automatically generate a high-quality multi-turn chat corpus by leveraging ChatGPT to engage in a conversation with itself. The introduction of the Baize model and the Self-Distill with Feedback (SDF) technique also adds to the novelty of the paper.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, discussing the methodology employed for generating a high-quality multi-turn chat corpus, the parameter-efficient tuning approach used to enhance the LLaMA model, and the Self-Distill with Feedback (SDF) technique proposed to further improve the performance of the Baize models.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and provides a clear explanation of the proposed pipeline, the Baize model, and the SDF technique. The inclusion of an online demo and the release of the Baize models and data for research purposes also adds to the enjoyment of the paper.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
