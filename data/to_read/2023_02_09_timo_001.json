{"Published": "2023-02-09", "Title": "Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools", "Authors": "Timo Schick, Jane Dwivedi-Yu, Roberto Dess\u00ec, Roberta Raileanu, Maria Lomeli, Luke Zettlemoyer, Nicola Cancedda, Thomas Scialom", "Summary": "Language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable abilities to solve new tasks from just a few examples or textual instructions, especially at scale. They also, paradoxically, struggle with basic functionality, such as arithmetic or factual lookup, where much simpler and smaller models excel. In this paper, we show that LMs can teach themselves to use external tools via simple APIs and achieve the best of both worlds. We introduce Toolformer, a model trained to decide which APIs to call, when to call them, what arguments to pass, and how to best incorporate the results into future token prediction. This is done in a self-supervised way, requiring nothing more than a handful of demonstrations for each API. We incorporate a range of tools, including a calculator, a Q\\&A system, two different search engines, a translation system, and a calendar. Toolformer achieves substantially improved zero-shot performance across a variety of downstream tasks, often competitive with much larger models, without sacrificing its core language modeling abilities.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Toolformer: A Self-Supervised Approach for LLMs to Learn Using External Tools", "description": "The paper introduces Toolformer, a novel approach that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to teach themselves to use external tools via simple APIs.

This approach can be applied to the same dataset used to pretrain a model, ensuring that the model does not lose any of its generality and language modeling abilities.", "example": "For instance, if an LLM is tasked with translating a text from a low-resource language, it can autonomously decide to call the machine translation API, pass the text as an argument, and incorporate the translated text into its future token prediction. Similarly, if the LLM needs to perform a complex arithmetic operation, it can call the calculator API and use the result to complete the task."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "Toolformer presents a novel approach to enhancing the capabilities of LLMs by enabling them to self-learn the use of external tools. This self-supervised learning approach, which requires only a handful of demonstrations for each API, is a unique contribution to the field of LLMs.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical as it delves into the specifics of how Toolformer is trained to decide which APIs to call, when to call them, what arguments to pass, and how to best incorporate the results into future token prediction. However, the concepts are explained clearly and comprehensively, making it accessible to readers with a basic understanding of LLMs and APIs.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents an interesting approach to enhancing the capabilities of LLMs. The inclusion of a variety of tools and the explanation of how they can be used by the LLMs make the paper an engaging read. The clear presentation of the approach and the results also add to the readability of the paper.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
