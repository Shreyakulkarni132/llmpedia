{"Published": "2023-04-19", "Title": "Scaling Transformer to 1M tokens and beyond with RMT", "Authors": "Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, Mikhail S. Burtsev", "Summary": "This technical report presents the application of a recurrent memory to extend the context length of BERT, one of the most effective Transformer-based models in natural language processing. By leveraging the Recurrent Memory Transformer architecture, we have successfully increased the model's effective context length to an unprecedented two million tokens, while maintaining high memory retrieval accuracy. Our method allows for the storage and processing of both local and global information and enables information flow between segments of the input sequence through the use of recurrence. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which holds significant potential to enhance long-term dependency handling in natural language understanding and generation tasks as well as enable large-scale context processing for memory-intensive applications.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Scaling Transformer to 1M tokens and beyond with Recurrent Memory Transformer", "description": "The paper presents an application of recurrent memory to extend the context length of BERT, a popular Transformer-based model in natural language processing.

By augmenting a pre-trained BERT model with recurrent memory, the authors were able to store task-specific information across segments of 512 tokens each. During inference, the model effectively utilized memory for up to 4,096 segments with a total length of 2,048,000 tokens. This significantly exceeds the largest input size reported for transformer models. The RMT's ability to handle such long sequences can be particularly useful in tasks such as document summarization, machine translation, and other applications that require understanding of long-term dependencies.", "example": "For instance, in a document summarization task, a typical transformer model might struggle to handle the entire document if it exceeds a certain length. However, with the RMT architecture, the model can effectively process and understand the entire document, regardless of its length, leading to more accurate and coherent summaries."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to scaling transformer models to handle exceptionally long sequences.
