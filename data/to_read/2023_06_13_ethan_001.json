{"Published": "2023-06-13", "Title": "Assigning AI: Seven Approaches for Students, with Prompts", "Authors": "Ethan Mollick, Lilach Mollick", "Summary": "This paper examines the transformative role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education and their potential as learning tools, despite their inherent risks and limitations. The authors propose seven approaches for utilizing AI in classrooms: AI-tutor, AI-coach, AI-mentor, AI-teammate, AI-tool, AI-simulator, and AI-student, each with distinct pedagogical benefits and risks. The aim is to help students learn with and about AI, with practical strategies designed to mitigate risks such as complacency about the AI's output, errors, and biases. These strategies promote active oversight, critical assessment of AI outputs, and complementarity of AI's capabilities with the students' unique insights. By challenging students to remain the \"human in the loop,\" the authors aim to enhance learning outcomes while ensuring that AI serves as a supportive tool rather than a replacement. The proposed framework offers a guide for educators navigating the integration of AI-assisted learning in classrooms", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Seven Approaches for Utilizing AI in Classrooms", "description": "The paper presents a comprehensive framework for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational settings. The authors propose seven distinct roles for AI in classrooms: AI-tutor, AI-coach, AI-mentor, AI-teammate, AI-tool, AI-simulator, and AI-student. Each role is characterized by unique pedagogical benefits and risks, and the authors provide practical strategies to mitigate these risks. The framework is designed to promote active oversight, critical assessment of AI outputs, and complementarity of AI's capabilities with the students' unique insights. The authors emphasize the importance of keeping the student as the 'human in the loop', ensuring that AI serves as a supportive tool rather than a replacement."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "AI as a Supportive Tool in Education", "description": "The proposed framework provides a practical guide for educators to integrate AI-assisted learning in classrooms. The seven roles for AI in classrooms can be used to enhance learning outcomes and mitigate risks associated with AI's output, errors, and biases. The framework encourages active student participation and critical thinking, ensuring that AI serves as a supportive tool rather than a replacement. This approach can be used to develop AI-based educational tools that promote active learning and critical thinking.", "example": "For instance, an AI-tutor can provide personalized instruction to students, while an AI-mentor can provide feedback and guidance. An AI-teammate can collaborate with students on projects, while an AI-tool can assist students in completing tasks. An AI-simulator can provide realistic simulations for experiential learning, and an AI-student can learn from human students, providing them with an opportunity to teach and reinforce their knowledge."}, "category": "USE CASES", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel framework for integrating AI into classrooms, proposing seven distinct roles for AI in education. While the use of AI in education is not new, the authors' approach of defining specific roles for AI and providing strategies to mitigate associated risks is a unique contribution to the field.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is not overly technical. It focuses on the application of AI in education, providing practical strategies for integrating AI into classrooms. The authors do not delve into the technical details of AI or LLMs, making the paper accessible to a wide audience, including educators and policymakers.", "technical_score": 1, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and organized, presenting a novel and intriguing contribution to the field of AI in education. It provides practical insights and strategies, making it an engaging and informative read for educators, policymakers, and researchers interested in the application of AI in education.", "enjoyable_score": 3}
