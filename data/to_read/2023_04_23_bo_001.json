In this paper, we focus on assessing the overall ability of ChatGPT using 7 fine-grained information extraction (IE) tasks. Specially, we present the systematically analysis by measuring ChatGPT's performance, explainability, calibration, and faithfulness, and resulting in 15 keys from either the ChatGPT or domain experts. Our findings reveal that ChatGPT's performance in Standard-IE setting is poor, but it surprisingly exhibits excellent performance in the OpenIE setting, as evidenced by human evaluation. In addition, our research indicates that ChatGPT provides high-quality and trustworthy explanations for its decisions. However, there is an issue of ChatGPT being overconfident in its predictions, which resulting in low calibration. Furthermore, ChatGPT demonstrates a high level of faithfulness to the original text in the majority of cases. We manually annotate and release the test sets of 7 fine-grained IE tasks contains 14 datasets to further promote the research. The datasets and code are available at https://github.com/pkuserc/ChatGPT_for_IE.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Comprehensive Evaluation of ChatGPT's Information Extraction Capabilities", "description": "The paper presents a systematic evaluation of ChatGPT's capabilities in information extraction (IE) tasks. The authors assess the model's performance, explainability, calibration, and faithfulness across seven fine-grained IE tasks. The study reveals that while ChatGPT's performance in a standard IE setting is poor, it excels in an OpenIE setting. The model also provides high-quality and trustworthy explanations for its decisions, although it tends to be overconfident in its predictions. The authors also note that ChatGPT is largely faithful to the original text in most cases. The paper contributes to the field by providing a comprehensive evaluation framework and releasing annotated test sets for future research."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "ChatGPT Shows Promise in OpenIE Setting and Provides Trustworthy Explanations", "description": "The paper's findings suggest that while ChatGPT may not perform well in a standard IE setting, it shows excellent performance in an OpenIE setting. This indicates that the model can be effectively used in scenarios where structured factual knowledge needs to be extracted from unstructured text without predefined labels. Furthermore, the model's ability to provide high-quality and trustworthy explanations for its decisions makes it a valuable tool for applications where transparency and interpretability are crucial. However, the model's tendency to be overconfident in its predictions should be taken into account when using it in real-world applications.", "example": "For instance, in a customer service scenario, ChatGPT could be used to extract relevant information from customer queries or complaints in an OpenIE setting. The model's explanations for its decisions could then be used to provide insights into its reasoning process, helping customer service representatives understand and address customer issues more effectively."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of ChatGPT's capabilities in information extraction tasks, which is a significant contribution to the field. However, the evaluation framework and the specific metrics used are not entirely novel, as they build upon existing methods in the field.", "novelty_score": 2, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it involves a detailed analysis of ChatGPT's performance on various information extraction tasks. It requires a good understanding of large language models and information extraction techniques. However, the authors explain their methodology and findings clearly, making the paper accessible to readers with a basic understanding of the field.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents a thorough analysis of ChatGPT's capabilities, making it an informative read for those interested in large language models and information extraction. The clear presentation of results and the inclusion of human evaluation add to the paper's readability and appeal.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
