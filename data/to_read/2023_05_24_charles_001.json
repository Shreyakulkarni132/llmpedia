{"Published": "2023-05-24", "Title": "Evidence of Meaning in Language Models Trained on Programs", "Authors": "Charles Jin, Martin Rinard", "Summary": "We present evidence that language models can learn meaning despite being trained only to perform next token prediction on text, specifically a corpus of programs. Each program is preceded by a specification in the form of (textual) input-output examples. Working with programs enables us to precisely define concepts relevant to meaning in language (e.g., correctness and semantics), making program synthesis well-suited as an intermediate testbed for characterizing the presence (or absence) of meaning in language models.   We first train a Transformer model on the corpus of programs, then probe the trained model's hidden states as it completes a program given a specification. Despite providing no inductive bias toward learning the semantics of the language, we find that a linear probe is able to extract abstractions of both current and future program states from the model states. Moreover, there is a strong, statistically significant correlation between the accuracy of the probe and the model's ability to generate a program that implements the specification. To evaluate whether the semantics are represented in the model states rather than learned by the probe, we design a novel experimental procedure that intervenes on the semantics of the language while preserving the lexicon and syntax. We also demonstrate that the model learns to generate correct programs that are, on average, shorter than those in the training set, which is evidence that language model outputs may differ from the training distribution in semantically meaningful ways. In summary, this paper does not propose any new techniques for training language models, but develops an experimental framework for and provides insights into the acquisition and representation of (formal) meaning in language models.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Language Models Trained on Programs Can Learn Meaning", "description": "The paper presents evidence that language models (LMs) can learn meaning, even when trained only to perform next token prediction on text, specifically a corpus of programs.

This has implications for the development of AI systems that can understand and generate code. For example, an AI system could be trained to understand a programming language and then generate code based on a given specification. This could potentially automate some aspects of software development, making the process more efficient.", "example": "Consider a scenario where a software developer needs to write a program based on a given specification. Instead of writing the code manually, the developer could use a language model trained on a corpus of programs. The model would generate a program that implements the specification, saving the developer time and effort."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to understanding how language models learn meaning. While previous research has explored how language models learn to predict the next token in a sequence, this paper goes a step further by investigating how these models learn the semantics of a programming language. The introduction of a novel experimental procedure to evaluate whether the semantics are represented in the model states is a significant contribution to the field.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is highly technical, requiring a solid understanding of language models, Transformer models, and programming languages. The authors delve into the details of their experimental procedure and present their findings with statistical analysis, making the paper a dense read for those unfamiliar with these concepts.", "technical_score": 3, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents a novel approach to understanding how language models learn meaning.
