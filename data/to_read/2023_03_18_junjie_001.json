However, despite the abundance of research on the difference in capabilities between GPT series models and fine-tuned models, there has been limited attention given to the evolution of GPT series models' capabilities over time. To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities of GPT series models, we select six representative models, comprising two GPT-3 series models (i.e., davinci and text-davinci-001) and four GPT-3.5 series models (i.e., code-davinci-002, text-davinci-002, text-davinci-003, and gpt-3.5-turbo). We evaluate their performance on nine natural language understanding (NLU) tasks using 21 datasets. In particular, we compare the performance and robustness of different models for each task under zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Our extensive experiments reveal that the overall ability of GPT series models on NLU tasks does not increase gradually as the models evolve, especially with the introduction of the RLHF training strategy. While this strategy enhances the models' ability to generate human-like responses, it also compromises their ability to solve some tasks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that there is still room for improvement in areas such as model robustness.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Comprehensive Analysis of GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 Series Models' Capabilities", "description": "The paper presents a thorough analysis of the capabilities of GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 series models, focusing on their evolution over time.

The findings suggest that while the RLHF training strategy enhances the models' ability to generate human-like responses, it also compromises their ability to solve some tasks. This understanding can help in fine-tuning these models for specific tasks or in developing new training strategies. For instance, one could design a hybrid training strategy that combines the strengths of RLHF with other strategies to improve both the human-like response generation and task-solving abilities of the models.", "example": "For example, if you are working on a task that requires a high level of human-like response generation, you might choose to use a model trained with the RLHF strategy. However, if your task requires a high level of problem-solving ability, you might need to consider other training strategies or a combination of strategies."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolution and capabilities of GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 series models, which is a unique contribution to the existing body of research. While many studies have focused on comparing the performance of specific GPT series models to fine-tuned models for particular tasks, a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of GPT series models has been lacking. This study fills that gap by evaluating six representative models on nine different NLU tasks using 21 datasets.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical as it involves a detailed analysis of the capabilities of GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 series models on various NLU tasks. It requires a good understanding of these models, their training strategies, and the tasks they are evaluated on.
