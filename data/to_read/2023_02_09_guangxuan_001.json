{"Published": "2023-02-09", "Title": "Offsite-Tuning: Transfer Learning without Full Model", "Authors": "Guangxuan Xiao, Ji Lin, Song Han", "Summary": "Transfer learning is important for foundation models to adapt to downstream tasks. However, many foundation models are proprietary, so users must share their data with model owners to fine-tune the models, which is costly and raise privacy concerns. Moreover, fine-tuning large foundation models is computation-intensive and impractical for most downstream users. In this paper, we propose Offsite-Tuning, a privacy-preserving and efficient transfer learning framework that can adapt billion-parameter foundation models to downstream data without access to the full model. In offsite-tuning, the model owner sends a light-weight adapter and a lossy compressed emulator to the data owner, who then fine-tunes the adapter on the downstream data with the emulator's assistance. The fine-tuned adapter is then returned to the model owner, who plugs it into the full model to create an adapted foundation model. Offsite-tuning preserves both parties' privacy and is computationally more efficient than the existing fine-tuning methods that require access to the full model weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of offsite-tuning on various large language and vision foundation models. Offsite-tuning can achieve comparable accuracy as full model fine-tuning while being privacy-preserving and efficient, achieving 6.5x speedup and 5.6x memory reduction.

This approach can be particularly useful for organizations that deal with sensitive data or have limited computational resources. By using a lightweight adapter and a lossy compressed emulator, Offsite-Tuning allows for the fine-tuning of models without requiring access to the full model weights. This not only preserves the privacy of both the data and the model, but also reduces computational requirements, making it a practical solution for a wide range of real-world applications.", "example": "For instance, a healthcare organization could use Offsite-Tuning to adapt a large language model for a specific task, such as medical text analysis, without having to share sensitive patient data with the model owner. The organization would receive a lightweight adapter and a lossy compressed emulator from the model owner, fine-tune the adapter on their own data with the help of the emulator, and then return the fine-tuned adapter to the model owner. The model owner would then plug the adapter into the full model to create an adapted model that can be used for the specific task."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "Offsite-Tuning introduces a novel approach to transfer learning that addresses the challenges of privacy and computational efficiency.
