{"Published": "2023-07-23", "Title": "DetectGPT: Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature", "Authors": "Eric Mitchell, Yoonho Lee, Alexander Khazatsky, Christopher D. Manning, Chelsea Finn", "Summary": "The increasing fluency and widespread usage of large language models (LLMs) highlight the desirability of corresponding tools aiding detection of LLM-generated text. In this paper, we identify a property of the structure of an LLM's probability function that is useful for such detection. Specifically, we demonstrate that text sampled from an LLM tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model's log probability function. Leveraging this observation, we then define a new curvature-based criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM. This approach, which we call DetectGPT, does not require training a separate classifier, collecting a dataset of real or generated passages, or explicitly watermarking generated text. It uses only log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations of the passage from another generic pre-trained language model (e.g., T5). We find DetectGPT is more discriminative than existing zero-shot methods for model sample detection, notably improving detection of fake news articles generated by 20B parameter GPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest zero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for DetectGPT.

This method can be applied to any LLM without the need for additional training or data collection, making it a versatile tool for LLM practitioners.", "example": "For instance, if a news organization wants to verify the authenticity of an article, they can use DetectGPT to analyze the text. The system would generate minor perturbations of the text using a pre-trained language model, then compare the log probability of the original text with each perturbed sample. If the average log ratio is high, the text is likely machine-generated."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "DetectGPT presents a novel approach to detecting machine-generated text by leveraging a unique property of LLMs. While previous methods have relied on training separate classifiers or collecting datasets of real or generated passages, DetectGPT requires only the log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations of the passage from another pre-trained language model. This represents a significant advancement in the field of machine-generated text detection.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, delving into the mathematical properties of LLMs and the concept of probability curvature. However, the authors do a good job of explaining these concepts in an accessible way, and the practical implications of the research are clearly outlined. The paper would be understandable to someone with a background in machine learning or natural language processing.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents an interesting and novel approach to a significant problem in the field of AI.
