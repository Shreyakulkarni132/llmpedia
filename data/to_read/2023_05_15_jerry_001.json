Le", "Summary": "We present symbol tuning - finetuning language models on in-context input-label pairs where natural language labels (e.g., \"positive/negative sentiment\") are replaced with arbitrary symbols (e.g., \"foo/bar\"). Symbol tuning leverages the intuition that when a model cannot use instructions or natural language labels to figure out a task, it must instead do so by learning the input-label mappings.   We experiment with symbol tuning across Flan-PaLM models up to 540B parameters and observe benefits across various settings. First, symbol tuning boosts performance on unseen in-context learning tasks and is much more robust to underspecified prompts, such as those without instructions or without natural language labels. Second, symbol-tuned models are much stronger at algorithmic reasoning tasks, with up to 18.2% better performance on the List Functions benchmark and up to 15.3% better performance on the Simple Turing Concepts benchmark. Finally, symbol-tuned models show large improvements in following flipped-labels presented in-context, meaning that they are more capable of using in-context information to override prior semantic knowledge.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Symbol Tuning Enhances In-Context Learning in Large Language Models", "description": "The paper introduces symbol tuning, a finetuning procedure for large language models (LLMs) that replaces natural language labels with arbitrary symbols in in-context input-label pairs. The intuition behind this approach is that when a model cannot rely on instructions or relevant natural language labels to figure out a task, it must instead learn from the input-label mappings. The authors experiment with symbol tuning across Flan-PaLM models up to 540B parameters and observe significant improvements in various settings. Symbol tuning boosts performance on unseen in-context learning tasks, is more robust to underspecified prompts, and shows substantial improvements in algorithmic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, symbol-tuned models show large improvements in following flipped-labels presented in-context, indicating their enhanced ability to use in-context information to override prior semantic knowledge."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Symbol Tuning Offers a Robust Approach to Enhance In-Context Learning in LLMs", "description": "Symbol tuning presents a promising approach to enhance the performance of LLMs in in-context learning tasks. By replacing natural language labels with arbitrary symbols, the model is forced to learn from the input-label mappings, making it more robust to underspecified prompts. This approach can be particularly useful in scenarios where the task is not clearly defined or where the prompts lack instructions or natural language labels. Furthermore, symbol tuning can be easily implemented and only requires a relatively small amount of compute, making it a practical and efficient method for improving the performance of LLMs.", "example": "For instance, in a sentiment analysis task, instead of using 'positive' or 'negative' labels, one could use arbitrary symbols like 'foo' or 'bar'. The model then learns to associate 'foo' with positive sentiment and 'bar' with negative sentiment based on the input-label mappings. This forces the model to learn from the context rather than relying on pre-existing semantic knowledge."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "Symbol tuning introduces a novel approach to finetuning LLMs by replacing natural language labels with arbitrary symbols.

It provides a detailed analysis of the performance improvements achieved through symbol tuning in various settings and tasks. However, the concepts and methodologies are explained clearly, making the paper accessible to readers with a basic understanding of LLMs and finetuning procedures.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents a novel approach to enhancing the performance of LLMs in a clear and concise manner. The use of examples and visual aids further enhances the readability of the paper. The significant improvements achieved through symbol tuning, as demonstrated through various experiments, make for an engaging and insightful read.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
