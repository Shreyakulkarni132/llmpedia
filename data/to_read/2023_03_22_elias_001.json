{"Published": "2023-03-22", "Title": "SparseGPT: Massive Language Models Can Be Accurately Pruned in One-Shot", "Authors": "Elias Frantar, Dan Alistarh", "Summary": "We show for the first time that large-scale generative pretrained transformer (GPT) family models can be pruned to at least 50% sparsity in one-shot, without any retraining, at minimal loss of accuracy. This is achieved via a new pruning method called SparseGPT, specifically designed to work efficiently and accurately on massive GPT-family models. We can execute SparseGPT on the largest available open-source models, OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B, in under 4.5 hours, and can reach 60% unstructured sparsity with negligible increase in perplexity: remarkably, more than 100 billion weights from these models can be ignored at inference time. SparseGPT generalizes to semi-structured (2:4 and 4:8) patterns, and is compatible with weight quantization approaches. The code is available at: https://github.com/IST-DASLab/sparsegpt.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "SparseGPT: Efficient One-Shot Pruning for Large Language Models", "description": "The paper introduces SparseGPT, a novel pruning method for large-scale generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models.

The method is designed to work efficiently on massive GPT-family models, and can be executed on the largest available open-source models in under 4.5 hours.

By pruning models to at least 50% sparsity without retraining, SparseGPT can significantly reduce the memory requirements and computational costs of these models, making them more accessible for deployment on less powerful hardware. Furthermore, the method's compatibility with weight quantization approaches offers additional avenues for model compression. The authors provide the code for SparseGPT, making it readily available for practitioners to apply to their own models.", "example": "For instance, if you have a large GPT model trained for a specific task, you can use SparseGPT to prune the model without retraining. This can be done by executing the provided code on your model, specifying the desired level of sparsity. The pruned model will have significantly reduced memory requirements, making it easier to deploy on less powerful hardware, while maintaining similar levels of accuracy."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "SparseGPT introduces a novel approach to pruning large language models, offering a significant improvement over existing methods in terms of efficiency and scalability. The ability to prune models to at least 50% sparsity in one-shot, without retraining, and with minimal loss of accuracy, is a unique contribution that has not been demonstrated in previous work.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is highly technical, delving into the specifics of the SparseGPT algorithm, including its mathematical underpinnings and computational complexity. It requires a solid understanding of machine learning concepts, particularly related to model pruning and large language models, to fully comprehend.", "technical_score": 3, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and provides a clear explanation of the SparseGPT method, its implementation, and its benefits. The inclusion of experimental results and comparisons with existing methods adds to the paper's readability and provides a clear demonstration of SparseGPT's effectiveness.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
