However, enabling general inference in the real world, e.g., for robotics problems, raises the challenge of grounding. We propose embodied language models to directly incorporate real-world continuous sensor modalities into language models and thereby establish the link between words and percepts. Input to our embodied language model are multi-modal sentences that interleave visual, continuous state estimation, and textual input encodings. We train these encodings end-to-end, in conjunction with a pre-trained large language model, for multiple embodied tasks including sequential robotic manipulation planning, visual question answering, and captioning. Our evaluations show that PaLM-E, a single large embodied multimodal model, can address a variety of embodied reasoning tasks, from a variety of observation modalities, on multiple embodiments, and further, exhibits positive transfer: the model benefits from diverse joint training across internet-scale language, vision, and visual-language domains. Our largest model, PaLM-E-562B with 562B parameters, in addition to being trained on robotics tasks, is a visual-language generalist with state-of-the-art performance on OK-VQA, and retains generalist language capabilities with increasing scale.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "PaLM-E: A Large Embodied Multimodal Language Model for Real-World Inference", "description": "The paper introduces PaLM-E, an embodied multimodal language model that incorporates real-world continuous sensor modalities into language models, establishing a link between words and percepts. PaLM-E operates on multimodal sentences, i.e., sequences of tokens where inputs from arbitrary modalities (e.g., images, neural 3D representations, or states) are inserted alongside text tokens as input to a large language model (LLM), trained end-to-end. The model is trained for multiple embodied tasks, including sequential robotic manipulation planning, visual question answering, and captioning. The authors demonstrate that PaLM-E, a single large embodied multimodal model, can address a variety of embodied reasoning tasks, from a variety of observation modalities, on multiple embodiments. The model also exhibits positive transfer, benefiting from diverse joint training across internet-scale language, vision, and visual-language domains."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "PaLM-E: A Step Towards More Grounded Inference in Real-World Applications", "description": "PaLM-E's ability to incorporate real-world continuous sensor modalities into language models opens up new possibilities for more grounded inference in real-world applications, particularly in robotics. By training these encodings end-to-end, in conjunction with a pre-trained large language model, for multiple embodied tasks, the model can address a variety of embodied reasoning tasks. This could be particularly useful in applications where a robot needs to interact with its environment based on visual inputs and make decisions accordingly. For instance, in a warehouse setting, a robot could use this model to plan its actions based on the visual input it receives, such as identifying and picking up specific items.", "example": "Consider a scenario where a robot is tasked with sorting items in a warehouse. Given an image of the warehouse, the robot could use PaLM-E to generate a sequence of actions: 'Step 1: Move to the left corner. Step 2: Pick up the blue box. Step 3: Place the blue box on the right shelf.' This sequence of actions is generated based on the visual input and the robot's understanding of the task at hand."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The introduction of PaLM-E represents a significant advancement in the field of embodied language models.
