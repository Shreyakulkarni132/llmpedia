{"Published": "2023-05-10", "Title": "Better Language Models of Code through Self-Improvement", "Authors": "Hung Quoc To, Nghi D. Q. Bui, Jin Guo, Tien N. Nguyen", "Summary": "Pre-trained language models for code (PLMCs) have gained attention in recent research. These models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets using multi-modal objectives. However, fine-tuning them requires extensive supervision and is limited by the size of the dataset provided. We aim to improve this issue by proposing a simple data augmentation framework. Our framework utilizes knowledge gained during the pre-training and fine-tuning stage to generate pseudo data, which is then used as training data for the next step. We incorporate this framework into the state-of-the-art language models, such as CodeT5, CodeBERT, and UnixCoder. The results show that our framework significantly improves PLMCs' performance in code-related sequence generation tasks, such as code summarization and code generation in the CodeXGLUE benchmark.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Self-Improvement Framework Enhances Pre-trained Language Models for Code", "description": "The paper introduces a self-improvement framework for pre-trained language models for code (PLMCs) to enhance their performance in code-related sequence generation tasks.

By generating pseudo data from the knowledge gained during pre-training and fine-tuning, the framework provides additional high-quality training data, leading to improved model performance. This approach can be easily adapted to various PLMCs and can be particularly beneficial for tasks such as code summarization and code generation. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to popular PLMCs like CodeT5, CodeBERT, and UnixCoder, showing significant performance improvements.", "example": "For instance, if you are fine-tuning a PLMC like CodeBERT for a code summarization task, you can use this self-improvement framework to generate pseudo data from the knowledge gained during pre-training and fine-tuning. This pseudo data can then be used as additional training data for the next epoch, leading to improved model performance."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to improving the performance of pre-trained language models for code.
