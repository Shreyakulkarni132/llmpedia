{"Published": "2023-05-17", "Title": "Searching for Needles in a Haystack: On the Role of Incidental Bilingualism in PaLM's Translation Capability", "Authors": "Eleftheria Briakou, Colin Cherry, George Foster", "Summary": "Large, multilingual language models exhibit surprisingly good zero- or few-shot machine translation capabilities, despite having never seen the intentionally-included translation examples provided to typical neural translation systems. We investigate the role of incidental bilingualism -- the unintentional consumption of bilingual signals, including translation examples -- in explaining the translation capabilities of large language models, taking the Pathways Language Model (PaLM) as a case study. We introduce a mixed-method approach to measure and understand incidental bilingualism at scale. We show that PaLM is exposed to over 30 million translation pairs across at least 44 languages. Furthermore, the amount of incidental bilingual content is highly correlated with the amount of monolingual in-language content for non-English languages. We relate incidental bilingual content to zero-shot prompts and show that it can be used to mine new prompts to improve PaLM's out-of-English zero-shot translation quality. Finally, in a series of small-scale ablations, we show that its presence has a substantial impact on translation capabilities, although this impact diminishes with model scale.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Investigating Incidental Bilingualism in Large Language Models", "description": "The paper investigates the role of incidental bilingualism in the translation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), using the Pathways Language Model (PaLM) as a case study.

By mining new prompts from incidental bilingual content, the quality of out-of-English zero-shot translation can be improved. This approach can be particularly useful in applications where translation between multiple languages is required, such as in multilingual chatbots, automated translation services, and cross-lingual information retrieval systems.", "example": "For instance, in a multilingual chatbot application, understanding the role of incidental bilingualism can help in improving the chatbot's ability to translate user queries or responses across different languages. By mining new prompts from the incidental bilingual content, the chatbot can be trained to provide more accurate translations, thereby enhancing its overall performance."}, "category": "BEHAVIOR", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel investigation into the role of incidental bilingualism in the translation capabilities of LLMs. The mixed-method approach introduced to measure and understand incidental bilingualism at scale is a unique contribution. The findings provide new insights into how LLMs acquire translation capabilities, which is a significant addition to the existing body of knowledge in the field of LLMs.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, presenting a detailed analysis of the training data of the Pathways Language Model (PaLM) and conducting a series of experiments to assess the impact of incidental bilingualism on translation performance. However, the concepts and methodologies are explained clearly, making it accessible to readers with a basic understanding of LLMs and machine translation.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and presents an interesting investigation into the role of incidental bilingualism in LLMs. The clear presentation of the methodology and the detailed analysis of the results make it an engaging read for those interested in the field of LLMs and machine translation.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
