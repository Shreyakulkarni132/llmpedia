The former is defined as decomposing a potentially complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs can leverage these augmentations separately or in combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens prediction objective, such augmented LMs can use various, possibly non-parametric external modules to expand their context processing ability, thus departing from the pure language modeling paradigm. We therefore refer to them as Augmented Language Models (ALMs). The missing token objective allows ALMs to learn to reason, use tools, and even act, while still performing standard natural language tasks and even outperforming most regular LMs on several benchmarks. In this work, after reviewing current advance in ALMs, we conclude that this new research direction has the potential to address common limitations of traditional LMs such as interpretability, consistency, and scalability issues.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Augmented Language Models: Enhancing LMs with Reasoning and Tool Usage", "description": "This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of works that augment language models (LMs) with reasoning skills and the ability to use tools.

This opens up new possibilities for building systems or creating new products that leverage the capabilities of ALMs. For instance, an ALM could be used to build a more advanced chatbot that not only understands and generates natural language but also reasons and uses tools to provide more accurate and helpful responses.", "example": "Consider a customer service chatbot built using an ALM. When a user asks a complex question, the chatbot could decompose the question into simpler subtasks, use external modules to gather necessary information, and then combine the results to provide a comprehensive answer. This could significantly improve the chatbot's ability to handle complex queries and provide high-quality customer service."}, "category": "ARCHITECTURES", "novelty_analysis": "The survey paper provides a novel perspective on the development and application of Large Language Models (LLMs).
