While the technical level is concerned with accurate reconstruction of transmitted symbols, the semantic and effectiveness levels deal with the inferred meaning and its effect on the receiver. Thanks to telecommunications, the first level problem has produced great advances like the internet. Large Language Models (LLMs) make some progress towards the second goal, but the third level still remains largely untouched. The third problem deals with predicting and optimizing communication for desired receiver behavior. LLMs, while showing wide generalization capabilities across a wide range of tasks, are unable to solve for this. One reason for the underperformance could be a lack of \"behavior tokens\" in LLMs' training corpora. Behavior tokens define receiver behavior over a communication, such as shares, likes, clicks, purchases, retweets, etc. While preprocessing data for LLM training, behavior tokens are often removed from the corpora as noise. Therefore, in this paper, we make some initial progress towards reintroducing behavior tokens in LLM training. The trained models, other than showing similar performance to LLMs on content understanding tasks, show generalization capabilities on behavior simulation, content simulation, behavior understanding, and behavior domain adaptation. Using a wide range of tasks on two corpora, we show results on all these capabilities. We call these models Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs). Further, to spur more research on LCBMs, we release our new Content Behavior Corpus (CBC), a repository containing communicator, message, and corresponding receiver behavior.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Introducing Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs) for Enhanced Communication Understanding", "description": "The paper introduces Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs), a novel approach to Large Language Models (LLMs) training that incorporates 'behavior tokens'. These tokens represent receiver behavior over a communication, such as shares, likes, clicks, purchases, retweets, etc., and are typically removed from LLM training corpora as noise. The authors argue that the inclusion of these tokens can enhance the LLMs' ability to predict and optimize communication for desired receiver behavior. The LCBMs show similar performance to LLMs on content understanding tasks, but also demonstrate generalization capabilities on behavior simulation, content simulation, behavior understanding, and behavior domain adaptation. The authors also introduce a new Content Behavior Corpus (CBC), a repository containing communicator, message, and corresponding receiver behavior, to encourage further research."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "Behavior Tokens Enhance LLMs' Communication Understanding", "description": "The inclusion of behavior tokens in LLM training can significantly enhance the models' ability to understand and predict receiver behavior. This can be particularly useful in applications such as targeted advertising, where understanding and predicting user behavior is crucial. For instance, an LCBM could be used to predict how many people will purchase a product based on an ad, or to optimize an ad's message to achieve a certain click-through rate. The authors' new Content Behavior Corpus (CBC) also provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners looking to explore this area further.", "example": "For example, if an ad campaign is targeting new parents, an LCBM could be used to predict the click-through rate of different ad variants, and to optimize the ad's message to achieve a desired click-through rate. The LCBM could take into account various behavior tokens, such as likes, shares, and purchases, to make these predictions."}, "category": "TRAINING", "novelty_analysis": "The paper presents a novel approach to LLM training that incorporates behavior tokens, representing a significant departure from traditional LLM training methods. The introduction of Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs) and the new Content Behavior Corpus (CBC) also represent significant contributions to the field.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, as it introduces a new approach to LLM training and discusses its implementation in detail. However, the concepts are explained clearly and should be accessible to readers with a basic understanding of LLMs and machine learning.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-written and presents an interesting and novel approach to LLM training.
