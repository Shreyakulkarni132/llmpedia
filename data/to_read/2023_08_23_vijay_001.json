{"Published": "2023-08-23", "Title": "Prompt2Model: Generating Deployable Models from Natural Language Instructions", "Authors": "Vijay Viswanathan, Chenyang Zhao, Amanda Bertsch, Tongshuang Wu, Graham Neubig", "Summary": "Large language models (LLMs) enable system builders today to create competent NLP systems through prompting, where they only need to describe the task in natural language and provide a few examples. However, in other ways, LLMs are a step backward from traditional special-purpose NLP models; they require extensive computational resources for deployment and can be gated behind APIs. In this paper, we propose Prompt2Model, a general-purpose method that takes a natural language task description like the prompts provided to LLMs, and uses it to train a special-purpose model that is conducive to deployment. This is done through a multi-step process of retrieval of existing datasets and pretrained models, dataset generation using LLMs, and supervised fine-tuning on these retrieved and generated datasets. Over three tasks, we demonstrate that given the same few-shot prompt as input, Prompt2Model trains models that outperform the results of a strong LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo, by an average of 20% while being up to 700 times smaller. We also show that this data can be used to obtain reliable performance estimates of model performance, enabling model developers to assess model reliability before deployment. Prompt2Model is available open-source at https://github.com/neulab/prompt2model.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "Prompt2Model: A Framework for Generating Deployable Models from Natural Language Instructions", "description": "The paper introduces Prompt2Model, a method that takes a natural language task description and uses it to train a special-purpose model that is conducive to deployment.

The method allows for the creation of task-specific models that outperform LLMs in a few hours without any manual data annotation or architecture design. Furthermore, the modular and extensible design of Prompt2Model provides a platform for exploring new techniques in model distillation, dataset generation, synthetic evaluation, dataset retrieval, and model retrieval. This can lead to significant improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM applications.", "example": "For instance, a developer could use Prompt2Model to create a model for sentiment analysis. They would provide a natural language task description and a few examples, and Prompt2Model would retrieve relevant datasets and pretrained models, generate a new dataset using an LLM, and fine-tune a model on these datasets. The resulting model would be smaller, more efficient, and potentially more accurate than an LLM."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "Prompt2Model presents a novel approach to transitioning from LLM prototyping to practical deployment. The method's ability to generate deployable models from natural language instructions, and its use of a multi-step process involving retrieval of existing resources, dataset generation, and supervised fine-tuning, represents a significant advancement in the field.", "novelty_score": 3, "technical_analysis": "The paper is somewhat technical, detailing the architecture and components of the Prompt2Model framework. It discusses the process of retrieving datasets and models, generating datasets using LLMs, and fine-tuning models on these datasets. However, the concepts are explained clearly and should be accessible to readers with a background in machine learning and natural language processing.", "technical_score": 2, "enjoyable_analysis": "The paper is well-structured and provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the Prompt2Model framework. The authors effectively demonstrate the utility of their method through a series of experiments, making the paper an engaging and informative read for those interested in the practical deployment of LLMs.", "enjoyable_score": 2}
