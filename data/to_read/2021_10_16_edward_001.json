Hu, Yelong Shen, Phillip Wallis, Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li, Shean Wang, Lu Wang, Weizhu Chen", "Summary": "An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "LoRA: A Low-Rank Adaptation Technique for Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models", "description": "The paper introduces Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a novel technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) more efficiently. LoRA works by freezing the pre-trained model weights and injecting trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture. This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks, making the fine-tuning process less computationally expensive. The authors demonstrate that LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times compared to traditional fine-tuning methods. Despite having fewer trainable parameters, LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3."}, "takeaways": {"headline": "LoRA Enables Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs Without Compromising Performance", "description": "LoRA presents a practical solution for fine-tuning LLMs in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. It can be particularly useful when deploying multiple instances of fine-tuned models, where the computational cost can be prohibitive. The technique can be applied to various LLMs, including GPT-3, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, and it has been shown to maintain or even improve model quality despite the reduction in trainable parameters. This makes LoRA a valuable tool for practitioners working with LLMs, especially in resource-constrained environments.", "example": "For instance, if you are fine-tuning a GPT-3 model for a specific task, instead of retraining all 175 billion parameters, you can use LoRA to only train a small fraction of these parameters, significantly reducing the computational cost and memory requirement. The code for implementing LoRA is available at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA."}, "category": "FINE-TUNING", "novelty_analysis": "LoRA introduces a novel approach to fine-tuning LLMs that significantly reduces the computational cost without compromising performance.
