This paper aims to challenge this misconception. With sufficient training data, a 2 billion-parameter language model can accurately perform multi-digit arithmetic operations with almost 100% accuracy without data leakage, significantly surpassing GPT-4 (whose multi-digit multiplication accuracy is only 4.3%). We also demonstrate that our MathGLM, fine-tuned from GLM-10B on a dataset with additional multi-step arithmetic operations and math problems described in text, achieves similar performance to GPT-4 on a 5,000-samples Chinese math problem test set. Our code and data are public at https://github.com/THUDM/MathGLM.", "main_contribution": {"headline": "MathGLM: A Large Language Model for Accurate Arithmetic Operations and Math Problem Solving", "description": "The paper introduces MathGLM, a large language model (LLM) that can accurately perform complex arithmetic operations and solve math word problems without the need for external computational tools.

The proposed MathGLM model leverages a step-by-step strategy, which breaks down complex arithmetic expressions into simpler steps, enabling the model to learn the underlying calculation rules. This approach can be particularly useful in applications that require accurate numerical computations or problem-solving abilities, such as financial analysis, scientific computing, or educational technology. For instance, an LLM trained with this strategy could be used to develop an intelligent tutoring system that can solve complex math problems and explain the solution process step by step.", "example": "For example, given a complex arithmetic expression like '1234*7809/5678+9865', MathGLM would break it down into simpler steps: '1234*7809=9636306', '9636306/5678=1698.625', '1698.625+9865=10563.625'.
